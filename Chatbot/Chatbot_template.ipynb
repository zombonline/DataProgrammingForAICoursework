    "<b>Game Recommendation Chatbot: Frank</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "This application allows the user to interact in a natural tone about their interests in particular video games. The goal of the app is to extract the user's sentiment from their naturally formatted messages and use this to suitably recommend games based on these sentiments.The bot will parse text for any patterns that may indicate the player's preferred console and also the genre of games they prefer. On top of this, it will look out for any sort of descriptive keywords that might give some indication as to just exactly what the user is looking for. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bot uses the IGDB api to grab games along with some details from a database. These are grabbed based on platform and genre, the bot then scans through the games associated data (summary, keywords, themes) to scan for some of the keywords that were mentioned by the user. The more keywords a game matches, the higher the game will be sorted in a list. The bot will then recommend from this list. The rest of the games that did not match any keywords but do still match genre and platformer are then sorted by a ‘rating’ value also supplied by the api. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is all done in a very free flowing state. I wanted to avoid scenarios where a bot would require the player to respond to a set of questions one at a time or scenarios where the bot would specify how the user should format their messages exactly as I felt this would go against the nature of opting to design a chatbot for this sort of thing as it turns into a standard search bar that is harder to navigate. \n",
    "\n",
    "I made sure that any sort of loops or moments where the bot asks a question aren't a possible way that could result in the bot being stuck in a loop. For example if the bot is iterating through game recommendations and the user decides they want to refine their query or even just tell the bot their name, they can do so and the bot will react accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Three different scenarios of chatbot behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "The user may ask for platformers on the Nintendo Switch but then suddenly decide to tell the chatbot they have a XBOX mid way through the bot listing off recommendations. The bot would react to this by confirming with the user if it should update its memory to know the user’s preferred platform is XBOX. When prompted for games again it will suggest platformers (stored at the beginning) on the XBOX (stored just now).\n",
    "\n",
    "The user may say “My name is Fred” and then go through a bunch of different game recommendations then suddenly say something along the lines of “Actually, call me walter” and the bot will react by confirming if it should stop referring to the user as “Fred” and start using “Walter”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user may ask for racing games on the PlayStation one (with no extra specific keywords) and the bot would go through a bunch of random racing games (probably need for speeds), the user may get tired of iterating through and decide to refine their search by saying something like “I want a KART racer with items and multiplayer”, the bot would store this and begin its scan again, this time suggesting a game like Crash Team Racing right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "I utilized a lot of the material taught in lecture to hit different functionality of the bot. Such as the stuff we learned in week 4 & 5 about the natural language toolkit. I used this to tell the bot how to pick up any keywords that may be of use when refining the search for games. Also, the stuff taught earlier on such as regexes and just generally making use of jupyter notebooks was of great help. I used regexes to extract the most likely intent of the users messages and the use of Jupyter notebooks allowed me to extract and segregate particular parts of my code to iterate over and test with ease. This was especially vital when I was learning what I could do with the IGDB api and what it looks like to call it and what exactly is being sent back to my code.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the main loop and premise of my bot is fairly advanced and a little ambitious for the project especially given that I had to do a bulk of the work in a short amount of time due to other responsibilities and coursework."

    "In terms of timeliness, I don't think I'm able to effectively reflect on this due to how the second half of our university term has sort of panned out. Personally, I was assigned 6 different bits of coursework within a very short amount of time (three of which were due at the same time). When I factor in my personal life and responsibilities like starting a new job etc. I did not have much time for this coursework and infact a rather huge portion of this project was done in the final three days before it was actually due.\n",

    "On a more positive note, due to the short turn around time of this project, it was extremely easy to keep well organized as the project was fresh in my mind at all times. I had a similar approach to the EDA project where I would code away, getting stuff to work and then constantly loop back around and refactor my code to read better and be more maintainable for the future. I feel this is how I work best with projects like this that are fairly new concepts to me that I haven't explored and luckily python compliments this approach well with just how easy it is to get something going with minimal set up.\n"
