Some might still dislike though but that won't change my opinion on this game.\n\nAnything else; the music, the dialogue, the level design, the majority of the boss fight, all of the transformations, all the different color pallettes for Anton and Annie, JUST, EVERYTHING, IT'S AMAZING!!! My whole experience was just a blissful joy. I think about it all the time and I just smile, and maybe even giggle. Even the story, it's so silly and dumb, BUT MAAAAN, if you don't find enjoyment on the story, then what the heck??? Especially the entirety of the final boss (it really did things to my brain... in a positive way)..\n\nSummitsphere put so much work into this, and it shows!! It took it's time to get here, and that was the best decision they could've made, because MAN, THE WAIT WAS SO WORTH IT!! SO PLEASE, GIVE THIS GAME A CHANCE, IT DESERVES IT!!!\n\nEven if it means checking the demo, that would make me happy, because I love this game so much that I want to make sure everyone who gets this game, they'll be 100% sure they'll beat it, even if it means having to explain the difficulty just to make sure they get the best of time while playing Antonblast, because I'm sure as hell I will replay this in the proceedable future and more after!\n\nFinal verdict: IT KILLED IT!!! 9.8/10 GAME!!! THE REAL GAME OF THE YEAR OF 2024!!!"

        "review": "Definitely harder than I thought it would be, but still an incredibly fun platformer I'd recommend to anyone.\n\nTBH My biggest concern with the final game was how \"Happy Hour\" (the escape sequence) was going to be handled. Pizza Tower's \"Pizza Time\" was cool... but for most of the levels it was just starting a timer and that's it. No background/environment changes, no new gimmicks, just follow a new path and get back to the start. It was still fun but it didn't feel like the level was \"collapsing\", y'know?\n\nThis isn't the case at all in ANTONBLAST! It takes advantage of the whole \"escaping the level\" concept and does so much more with it. There were some levels I was even dreading hitting the Spirit Timer on because I had a feeling some crazy \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 was going to happen (and I was mostly right!)\n\nI got all of the collectibles in all of the levels. My only gripe was that the levels are fun on the first playthough (as well as coming back for the collectibles), however I'm not sure how often I'll be coming back to them after that. The two extra modes (time trial and combo chain), would be more fun IMO if the levels themselves were shorter, since they kinda feel like marathons.\n\nStill an awesome game I'd highly recommend!"

This fast pace, action packed, comedy-filled platformer is nothing but amazing, and I can highly recommend if you enjoy fast pace platformers. This game is perfect to a tea, but the only issues i'm having are the Time Trials and Combo Chain stage modes. They, as of current, force you into making absolutely perfect movements, or else you need to start right back at the beginning. Overall, a tremendous video game. ITS HAPPY HOUR!"

A beautifully vibrant burst of grungy cartoon energy meshed with challenging, yet forgiving platforming made for an incredibly solid gaming experience. This is not only a fantastic testament to video games themselves, but to the art of animation as well. Being alive to experience a video game as unique as this one, created by a team as passionate as Summitsphere, truly makes me happy, and endlessly excited to see what other upcoming games are influenced by works of art such as this one. Fantastic job all around.\n\n\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 paul"
