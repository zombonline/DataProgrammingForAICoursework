It feels tight at most and makes for a interesting and entertaining peice of gaming I could play for hours! It's definatley Summitsphere's pure gold and I would reccomend if you love games akin to this one!\n\nBosses and levels near the end might need a bit of work though, given that they feel a little too difficult to a point where you are always getting hit."

There's a LOT of rough spots, but the gameplay, music, 90s/2000s cartoons + games energy & overall passion makes this a new all time favorite\n\nI say it's a new favorite, but I think a few nerf and visual accessibility patches would go a long way to make the experience more tolerable."

        "review": "This game is what I wished Pizza Tower was back when it came out. Something about it just didn't click with me, probably how it was hyperfixated on having \"good runs\" on every level and grading everything you do (& also not a fan of the MS Paint artstyle and the fanbase of <= 12-year-old brainrots). Antonblast feels much closer to its Wario Land 4 origins, not just with its visuals and feelings, but level design too.\n\nThe music is PHENOMENAL. The humor is QUIRKY. Everything is EDGY and BADASS in the good kind of way!\n\nMy only gripe is the lack of things to do after beating the game. Sure, you can hunt for all the collectables and there are two alternative gamemodes, but when you get good enough to memorize level layout and boss attack patterns, it leaves me wishing for something more.\n\nDespite that, Antonblast is worth every penny. Buy it. Endorse it. Bust your balls while trying to no-hit-run the bosses. It's the true successor to the best platformer game ever made. Even just getting to experience all the levels for the first time is a fantastic experience, and slowly overcoming the toughest bosses is satisfying."

El juego tiene un carisma incre\u00edble de principio a fin lo cual lo eleva m\u00e1s que otros del mismo genero y consigue su propia identidad pese a tomar varias cosas prestadas de otras franquicias gracias a que pone su propio giro al asunto.\n\nLo m\u00e1s negativo que podr\u00eda decir es que el juego puede ser algo brutal para una buena cantidad de gente.\nNo es injusto pero definitivamente cometer\u00e1s errores y moriras hasta que el ritmo del juego te haga \u00a8clic\u00a8 y puedas fluir. Nada que un poco de aprendizaje con dosis de prueba y error no arregle.\n\nSin dudas el mejor juego del 2024 para mi, excelente trabajo a todos los responsables de crear esta joya.\n\nHAPPY HOUR ANTONBLAST!!"

The game has come a long way since then and I'm happy to say it was worth the wait. To be honest, this is probably one of the most fun games I've played in a while, and I say this as somebody who isn't huge into platformers.\n\nThe gameplay is fast, it feels great to play and it's especially fun going through levels quickly and destroying so much in your path. The levels so far have all been fun to play through, not a single level so far that has made me feel frustrated unlike most platformers I'd say. Not to mention that all of the bosses I've seen have been pretty unique to fight against.\n\nThe levels each have had their own unique mechanics, enemies and aesthetics to them. It's been keeping things fresh and unexpected going into the next one.\n\nArt style, music, sound design, and all the other small things have been really good as well. My only nitpicks are that sometimes it can be a little difficult to tell whats going on, and I'm not the biggest fan of some of the dialogue.\n\nA very solid 9/10 game. These guys have clearly poured their hearts into making AntonBlast and I hope they see huge success."

I disagree with the sentiment that the controls are \"sloppy\". The game is plenty responsive, it just revolves around momentum and buffering inputs so if you screw up you're likely to keep screwing up until you calm down and reset.\n\nI think between that and the sheer amount of stuff going on people wind up losing track of what's going on and feeling a lack of control. \"Takes getting used to\" isn't an automatic con for me. I got used to it, I have a taste for it. It's good that it's like this.\n\nThere *is* stuff I'd call \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, like a specific enemy being hidden behind a foreground element in Concrete Jungle, or generally the physics and clipping issues with Pinball Mire, but that A. isn't terribly common and B. doesn't stem from the game's core philosophy, so it could be fixed. The devs are currently patching the game to sand off rough edges like that.\n\nBut no, the game is just willing to get mean and rude to teach you things. You can draw parallels between the 1st miniboss and Pepperman in Pizza Tower for how they beat you into controlling your character better instead of mindlessly charging forward, for example. And it gets *tough* in the final act, a lot tougher than Pizza Tower.\n\nExcited for more from Summitsphere, kinda super hope they make a Wario Land 3-like with this skeleton."

I love the art style and animation, and the music is really good, and the gameplay is really satisfying and fun. There were many times where I lost track of where Anton was on the screen, and some bosses had moments where I was like, \"there's so much stuff happening, how am I expected to dodge this?\" But it was never enough to annoy me or dislike the game or anything.\n\nThere's so much weird cool dumb stuff in it, like the cowboy hat and shutter shades, the \"funny\" tv, the one tiny devil thing in the glasshouse level that says \"don't screw up! Don't choke!\" The music tapes, the scream button. Stuff that feels like the devs were just goofing off, yknow. And the way everything is presented, the spectacle of it all, it really shows that the devs loved what they were making, and I gotta say, the love is infectious. This game made me want to be in the house like carpet"

        "review": "\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1JODER ESTE JUEGO ES MEGASOMBROSO!!! MIL APLAUSOS PARA SUMPITSPHERE!!\n\nAntonblast supero bastante mis expectativas, si te gusta los juegos de acci\u00f3n, ca\u00f3ticos, de Wario Land y plataformeo este juego es para t\u00ed.\nEl juego es muy creativo y muy adictivo. Constantemente estar\u00e1s rompiendo cosas, matando enemigos y impactado de todo lo que te ofrece este titulo, por ende quiero destacar algunas cosas de este:.\n\nCOSAS DESTACABLES:\n\n1. ESTILO GR\u00c1FICO: El juego toma de inspiraci\u00f3n sobre muchos juegos de la Game boy advance, cosa que me encanta, parece que estas jugando desde esa consola. Los sprites estan muy bien trabajados, llamativos e interesantes y los usan de muy buena manera, hay escenas asombrosas usando simplemente pixels. \u00a1Bien hecho!\n\n2. JEFES : Cuphead \u00bfQui\u00e9n te conoce? \u00a1LOS JEFES SON UNA PTA MARAVILLA! SON INCRE\u00cdBLES.\nSon un espect\u00e1culo, la forma que te atacan, las diversas maneras con las que debes derrotarlos y sobre todo el carisma que tienen estos. Bien hecho. Te recomiendo ver gameplays de los jefes.\n\n3. NIVELES: Hay niveles que me gustaron mucho, son muy creativos como Bomb Candy Mines, su apartado visual, la mecanica de la bomba y el escape son elementos destacados de este nivel o como Concrete Jungle, su m\u00fasica es increible, los enemigos, la verticalidad de esta y sus mec\u00e1nicas.\n\n4. PERSONAJES: Los personajes son muy carismaticos, todos tienen su personalidades que m\u00e1s de alguna sonrisa te sacaran, sobre todo Satan, Annie y los mini demonios. Estos ultimos son uno de mis favoritos, espero que traduzcan el juego a otros idiomas...\n\n5. NIVELES: Los niveles tienen diversas maneras de pasarlos y ambas tienen su \u00fanica forma. \u00bfJugar pinball para pasarlo? \u00bfEscapar de un robot gigante para regresar? ESTO ES GENIAL aunque hay algunos medio raros como the Big Bath que literalmente son backrooms, pero bueno. Ademas el juego sigue la misma formula de Pizza tower, llegar al final y luego regresar a la entrada para completarlo. Si, no puede ser original, pero huir de los niveles son la mejor parte de estos. Todo el mundo se levantar\u00e1 en tu contra con tal de que no llegues al ascensor. Es muy divertido y ca\u00f3tico.\n\n6. M\u00daSICA: Sin palabras, debes de escucharlo...\n\nAntonblast es un Asombroso juego, me gusto mucho, sinceramente no tengo ninguna queja, debes de compr\u00e1rtelo, vale la pena el precio. Esta fue mi rese\u00f1a, espero haberte ayudado..."

        "review": "Not really a fan, sadly.\n\nThe levels are doable but oddly quite long and poorly paced. I feel a huge chunk of development likely took place in the first level, as it feels a whole lot more polished than pretty much everything after it. The \u201cWario-Land-4-approach\u201d to levels, having an escape, also does not feel as thought-out and integrated into the level design as it could have. Having longer levels means you have to raise the time limit for the return, which makes mistakes along the way feel more impactful and as though there almost isn\u2019t even a need for a timer anymore.\n\nThat said, it feels as though checkpoints were a quick-and-dirty fix to the difficulty. Instead of retouching the length of levels, let\u2019s just make it so the player doesn\u2019t have to restart from the very beginning if he screws up. Over time, this dampens the sense of punishment of messing up, driving a player to want to make a full run better, and replaces it with a NEW kind of punishment more akin to, \u201cgreat, I\u2019m stuck at this point until I figure out what the game wants me to do.\u201d\n\nThe move set is a bit polarizing; I think it\u2019s pretty interesting, but it has its quirks I can\u2019t get behind. The bouncing is the biggest of these. If the player touches the spin button again at all when he\u2019s already in a spin, he HAS TO wait for another bounce to complete. As far as I could tell, there\u2019s no cancellation. This is one of a few choices with the controls I found pretty frustrating for a game with fast-paced escape sequences.\n\nThe game has a lot of personality, especially in its visuals, but the referential bits don\u2019t let you forget at any moment, \u201chey, did you know this is supposed to be a Wario game? Did you remember that?\u201d The audio design (soundfonts and character quips,) character\u2019s poses and actions, names of alternate colors, \u201cKeyzer-clones\u201d in every level\u2014 the game would feel a lot more interesting if it didn\u2019t force itself into the shadow of Wario Land games, and, instead, leaned into the unique personality that it DOES most certainly have otherwise. Being inspired is fine; intentionally trying to be an obsessive, gushing fan letter is not. I.e. The IP just needs to be itself."

        "review": "Bit of a warning, this game is NOT EASY. It's a much different experience than Pizza Tower and you might find yourself having to repeat a boss or a section of a level multiple times. However, the game will add checkpoints frequently in every level, as well as on boss stages. Check the \"hard\" section of this review for details.\n\nGimme the skinny!!\nAntonblast is a 2d sidescroller inspired by the Wario Land series of games, particularly Wario Land 4. Get to the end of a level while keeping an eye out for money and secrets. At the end of a level, HAPPY HOUR activates, and you have to rush back before the time runs out. You may choose to play as Dynamite Anton or his coworker Dynamite Annie on their way to get their boozy spirits back from Satan and his crazy zany minions.\n\nThis game is an insane balls-to-the-wall experience. It's art design is a huge 90s throwback to zany in-your-face advertising, so it's loud, explosive, and crazy as hell. I cannot stress this enough, it is seriously not for the faint of heart and is not afraid to be explosive and loud with everything. Check the Art section below for more details.\n\nThere really is no escaping the similarities. Pizza Tower has developed a much similar concept, and both games have been in development at around the same time. They both have mentioned each other in their respected Discord communities many times, and have a great respect for each other's work. McPig has even drawn Peppino frenching Anton. They're really made for each other.\n\nHowever, both games play in a completely different fashion, and you may be in a disappointment if you come in with certain expectations.\n\nWhile Pizza Tower allows for much more freedom of movement and enough breathing room to play how you want, this game's design does not allow for many screw-ups. You're allowed only 3 hits, you can't grab enemies, run up walls, or super jump to the top of the ceiling. Instead, you use your hammer to activate a boost called a CLUTCH, similar to Wario's Shoulder Bash. It's essentially a boost with a short burst, and with enough timing and skill, you can get through a level pretty quickly. You can also increase your jump a little bit by swinging your hammer in the air, then bouncing off of something like the floor or an enemy to give yourself some height and a spinning attack. It will slow you down significantly, but with enough skill, you can combo this spin attack with your boost to absolutely destroy enemies while clutching the hell outta there. You're allowed a health bar and some hearts throughout a level, but with only 3 hits to get through a section (with some minor health pickups), there's not much room for error.\n\nOn a normal run, it's pretty fair but tough. It's not Contra Hard Corps, but you will get your ass whopped if you're not ready. There's not a lot of modern conveniences either, so if you're a die-hard retro fan, you might have some fun with this.\n\nThis game is not afraid to throw things at you, cluttering up the screen with fun 90s nonsense. It's very reminiscent of an old-school Sega Genesis game: only 3 usable buttons with a simple gameplay loop and a ton of flashy explosions. It's great, but there are definitely moments where levels go on too long, or the camera shake gets in the way of something important. The game can definitely feel bloated with its design, and I really don't blame you if you need to take a break from even just one level. You can reduce this by turning off screen shake in the options menu.\n\nYou don't need anything from a level after beating it, not even a spirit. That means that secrets and money are not required (though money can really help and make the game easier). However, there are three ways to play a level after you beat it (Arcade, Combo, Time Trial), so there is more than enough replay value if you want to go for 100%. The camera can also feel like it's zoomed-in a bit too much, but if you know the level layout, it won't be too much of an issue.\n\nThe art is funking fantastic, and whoever is responsible for the art direction deserves massive props. It's extreme and urban in the best way, and I can definitely see this as proper graffiti. As opposed to improper graffiti, I guess. Very reminiscent of Sega Genesis and it's extreme in-your-face marketing that the 90s was known for. Even their trailers and teasers were on-point, with some guy yelling SUMMIT at the end of every video.\n\nFor the first few levels, it's a blast, and the spectacle isn't much of a problem. As the game goes on however, it feels as though they try to mash as much stuff in every level. There's not really a set rule on how long a level can go. So you'll be on a level in what feels like forever as you're getting explosions and enemies thrown at you from what feels like every angle. It can very easily feel overwhelming if you're not used to a game like this. I highly recommend either playing it in a window or turning screen shake off if it becomes too much. Playing this on Steam Deck on a tiny screen makes it feel much more enjoyable manageable to the senses, even with screen shake on. I'm sure the upcoming Switch version will also feel great on a handheld like that.\n\nEven in long levels, it seems like the game does everything in its power to give you a fair chance. There are multiple checkpoints and clear indicators, even on long bosses with multiple phases. But even then it feels like it's too much. Sometimes I'm begging a level end just to take a little break and absorb what I've just played. I feel like there is definitely a pacing issue in this game, but I don't know. It can be hard to critique a game and tell it to \"tone it down\" when it's meant to be in-your-face from the very beginning. Maybe I'm getting senile after my thirty years on this planet.\n\nI will say that after playing through everything, it's very fun to replay once I know what to expect. And with three ways to runback a level, they can be very enjoyable. I will also say that if you're of the Zoom variety of human beings, you will probably enjoy this game very much. I do not like that new Habbo Hotel on Amazon Prime, but if you're one of those Z-boys who love stuff like that, this may be up your alley.\n\nDespite all my whining about Anton coming in and shaking my head around, this game is a great spectacle and a proper Wariolike with tons to offer. It's not for everyone: it can be a bit difficult and very flashy, but if any part of the previews makes you go \"WOWWIE I GOTTA TRY THAT RIGHT NOW\", then this is most definitely the game for you."

After putting 13 hours into it, and completing the campaign, I wish I could of thrown more money at it.\n\nLets not beat around the bush, Antonblast is freaking MARVELOUS! As a big fan of 2D Platformers, this is one you should not pass up.\n\nIts funny, its challenging, its visually a treat, the music and sound design gets your blood pumping! I love a game that can give me a good time while also kick me in the nuts. It wears its inspirations on its shoulders and I love every moment of it.\n\nThe hellish combination of Crash Bandicoot, Cow & Chicken, Beavis and Butthead, Wario Land and a few other things had no business working this freaking good, man.\n\nOf course it goes without saying there are a few things I didn't click with at first, but the power of trial and error came through in the end. I appreciate how well collectables are hidden, incentivizing me to go back and replay levels. It was also exhilarating getting better at running through and learning the gimmicks the game throws at you. Comes in handy by the endgame, tho I hope the final level does see a few revisions with how punishing it can be at times. That is only a small nitpick tho to the really well made difficulty curve.\n\nBosses for me personally are a big highlight of this game. Usually bosses in 2D games run the gambit of being too easy, or not very interesting. The Bosses in Antonblast feel like actual FIGHTS. Being able to damage the bosses at all times while they're doing just as much to attack you is fantastic! Usually ending with a triumphant spectacle! Big props to the team for sure!\n\nBasically what i'm saying is, yeah, this is a must-have. Its hard not to call this AT LEAST a 9/10"

        "review": "HIGHLY RECOMMEND\n\nThis game is AMAZING! I'd highly recommend it for anyone looking for a Warioland-like game which isn't Pizza Tower. The music, gameplay, controls, gimmicks, they are all almost perfect! The game is a little short, clocking in at around 6hours, but that's only if you avoid most collectables and speed to the end.\n\nUnfortunately its hard to mention this game without bringing up Pizza Tower, as they are both modern revivals of the Warioland formula, however whilst Pizza Tower is potentially the better game, I do think Antonblast rises above in certain aspects like level length, difficulty and overall age rating with the cussing. My only real gripe is the high difficulty spike and poorly explained gimmicks, also NOT ALL SLOPES GIVE YOU THE BOWLING BALL JUST MAKE THEM LOOK DIFFERENT AAAAAAA-\n\nGo buy the game!\n\n(Reviewed after playing on Stream)"

        "review": "Another year, another excellent Wario Land inspired platformer.\n\nAntonblast takes the garlic-enjoyer genre to the next level by refining the traditional platforming and injecting it with a ton of style. The angular designs and snappy animation makes the game really stand out. The soundtrack is also full of great sample-heavy songs.\n\nWhile it's development buddy Pizza Tower took some influence from Sonic's speedy perfect level runs, Anton takes inspiration from Crash's destructive goofy platforming. Twinsanity is clearly a favorite as seen by Anton's fun wacky tone and one standout song on the soundtrack.\n\nAntonblast is as much of a lover letter to Crash as it is to Wario, but of course it carves out it's own style to become a fun destructive platformer."

        "review": "A beautiful love letter to tough-as-nails platformers. Both the art style and the gameplay are wonders on the senses and leave you wanting for more after you beat the final boss. Though the game is...relatively short (12 levels and 7 bosses, each representing the 7 deadly sins.), no level truly felt like a filler! Each level had a unique gimmick, and some of them even had a special escape sequence! Seriously, the bath level is so awesome.\n\nThough the game isn't without flaws, sometimes clashing art styles stick out. It's not the weird 3D effect on very few characters, but rather smaller things, like the little dog when you break a checkpoint, and the spray can look like a placeholder texture. its not something that ruins the experience but i felt like it could have been done better. Cutscenes also tend to look a bit...Stiff? Though it works to display the awkwardness of these characters just like the certain design choices. Sometimes, it just looks a bit off. Though this strangeness double works to the game's benefit to show that these characters are just awkward drunks, and though the cutscenes look stiff, the gameplay animations are far from looking bad. Speaking on top of gameplay the difficulty spikes are ROUGH. i feel like at times i would be throwing myself at the wall to either solve a collectible puzzle or beat a room/boss. not to mention some of the challenges feel counterintuitive. Yes, Antonblast devs i know you love your box/enemy jumps but can we PLEASE not use it so often? even worse that they don't respawn. though, of course, there are ways to counteract this punishing nature of the game, and that is to buy hearts. I'm so happy this game has a shop because one thing i noticed in Pizza Tower. A similarly great game that takes inspiration from the same source. is that all the money and score you collect in that game amounts too well...Nothing! you use it to unlock boss doors and eventually toss it back to get an...alright skin. in Anton's, you can buy buffs, cosmetics, and permanent health upgrades! i like that! it makes me feel like actually scoring better can lead to an easier time.\n\nthough back on the critiques, this game is funny; it has some random memes that will catch you off guard, and honestly, I'm all for it. If you want a fun time where the developers put in their time and love of the genre into every facet of the game\n\nHowever, a thing to note before you buy this product is to try not to compare Pizza Tower to Antonblast. though they are very alike, these are definitely two different experiences, and one is SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER. Like most indie darlings GO INTO THIS GAME AS BLIND AS POSSIBLE. i HATE how every boss in [insert game] spoils probably some of the most surprising boss fights in the game. this game HAS surprises, and your learning about them does pay off. Enjoy the 5-10 hours without looking up anything. it WILL be worth it.\n\npros:\n\n+Amazing gameplay\n+Wonderful Graphics\n+Awesome soundtrack\n+amazing level designs\n+Potential for DLC\n+genuine Care for the process of making this a game\n\ncon:\n\nimma be honest. I got nothing outside of nitpicks and things that can be avoided by playing a bit more smart. Buy hearts. PLEASE\n\n10/10\n\nPlease continue to make games of this quality. because we all know the companies that SHOULD be making games like this won't. You will not be disappointed for buying this game"

It invests in this style so much that the art also seems to take pointers from it.\n\nIf this were the future of games, I would become much more heavily invested. The art is filled with life and detail despite the cel-shaded style, filled with aggressively asymmetric shapes to lend towards the air of chaos and mayhem that this game advertises itself on. It chooses to work with the audience that Pizza Tower created and keep their attention. That it stands on its own and is different enough to avoid comparison removes any anxieties I might have had going in.\n\nAlso, being designed in this low-fidelity style means that you can gift this to a friend that has a potato calling itself a computer. I could probably play this on my old Windows XP machine from 2008 if it didn't state Windows 8 in the requirements.\n\nLook, just get it. The asking price is steep for an indie game, but it's also much more lively and memorable than some AAA game experiences have been lately."

        "review": "Honestly? Everything I was hoping for out of this game.\nWhile I don't have the skills nor time required to 100% the entire thing, much less get CRACKED on every stage, the game itself was, from start to finish, an adrenaline filled love letter to Wario Land 4 (And to a somewhat lesser extent, Crash) fans.\n\nThe artstyle's downright DELICIOUS, with bright colors and sharp angles everywhere to really sell that gritty vibe the game's aiming for. They really nail the whole \"This could be a Gameboy Advance title\" feeling with the cutscenes and way the sprites move, as well.\nThe music slaps so hard, and I can't think of a single stage or boss theme that I didn't thoroughly enjoy, from start to finish. (Can't wait for the official OST to release, \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.)\nThe transformations are ALMOST all incredibly fun, unique, and simply wonderful to use (looking at you, jetpack...) and they REALLY capture the \"Wario Land\" vibe of what makes a transformation great.\nThe game simply feels GOOD to play. Clutching, dashing, bouncing, and rolling your way through the stages feels *wonderful* once you get the hang of it. The control of it all takes a little bit to really get down, but once you do, it REALLY clicks into place.\nThe bosses in the later half of the game took some warming up to, but really? They're perfect for the game's overall control and vibe. As mentioned above, all their music is divine, and while your first run-through with them might be \"Oh GOD what the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 is happening!?\" due to the chaotic nature, once you understand it, MAN are they fun to fight.\n\nAnd, of course, on top of ALL of this, the Devil himself is voiced by none other than Gianni Matragrano, and he REALLY makes the character come to life.\n\nIf you're even remotely a fan of the Wario Land titles, ESPECIALLY 4...\n\n\nIt is MORE than worth the money, you won't regret it."

I expect the speed-running scene for this game to pop off and rightfully so.\n\nThe only nitpick I really have is the bossbusters, I really wanted more screentime with them besides their relatively easy boss fights.\nOn the other hand, the main bosses are stellar standouts, is my favourite of the lot by far, not including .....that fight...? Whoo boy. You're in for a treat.\n\nBuy this damn game, the team at summitsphere deserve every penny they get from this gem."

The game oozes with style and an absurd comedy reminiscent of the 90' to 2000s American cartoon. Don't even get me started on the soundtrack... stellar. The game isn't easy sure, but it still is fair and offers solutions and help to those new to the genre. In conclusion, either the well seasoned platformers master or the newbie just looking for a good time you may be, this game will stick to you like superglue."

As a newcomer to these kinds of fast paced skill based platformers, I really didn't expect to have as much fun as I did! Even the hardest most frustrating levels only made me want to buckle down and show it who's boss!! Speaking of, each boss fight was even more brilliant and stunning than the last, with gorgeous sprite work and phenomenal music! After following development for so long it was great to finally play it and have all of my expectations exceeded. Though I would warn prospective players to be wary of flashing lights and visual clutter; some fights or rooms can get very hectic visually with all the high speed action.\n\nHuge props to the Summitsphere team and everyone who put their hearts into this game, this is my GOTY for sure and I can't wait to see what Anton and pals will get up to next!"

This is easily my GOTY.\nWario Land and Crash Bandicoot are two of my all-time favorite platforming franchises, so to see a game like this so proudly be inspired by them (as well as bring its own unique, manic energy) is an easy way into my heart. It plays like a whirlwind of destruction, feels like it, and SOUNDS like it too (oh lord that soundtrack). Every level, enemy and boss is memorable and there is barely a single dull moment--the game is bursting with attitude in every way from start to finish. Even if you get mad at a hard or frustrating part, you'll always wanna try again to see what's next.\nAnd yes, the game has plenty of collectibles and challenges to overcome so there is absolutely no shortage of things to do in the game, you're getting your damn money's worth.\n\nSo why are you still holding onto that money of yours? Pick it up now, pick up on sale, get someone to pick it up for you. No matter how you pick it up, just... pick it up.\nPick it up... and"

When I first got the game, I was hyped as all hell. Beating this game took me a good day and a half, but when I beat it I felt an intense wave of satisfaction, but it left me wanting more. I still haven't beat the game yet, but this has been my game of the year."

        "review": "I have a hard time recommending this game because I can't really say I enjoyed what I played of it. I got to around level 6 or so - past the first set of levels - and in the end I just felt mixed.\n\nThe game is energetic, spastic, funny, and a visual/auditory joy to experience. It's also a nightmare to tell what's going on at times. The gameplay be fast, frantic, explosive, and enjoyable, but other times it can be frustrating, confusing, and annoying. I just kept going from \"I'm having fun\" to \"I'm not having fun\" constantly.\n\nFirst off, the game is a treat to look at artistically. I love the character designs, enemy designs, and levels. The music also slaps (no complaints about the music at all). The game is so caught up in its explosive art though that it makes it tough to play at times.\n\nThis is a game in 2024 where I actively complained about the to myself - which I don't think I've done since I played a GBA port of a game. Constantly there are times throughout the game where I felt I couldn't react to a jump, enemy, obstacle, etc, because the screen is simply too zoomed in. Also, because it's so zoomed in the game's graphics feel insanely difficult to parse at times. I like the pixelated look, but blown up on a 1440p screen it feels like I'm looking at an emulated GBA game (which may have been the point tbh). This makes the pixelated art style REALLY hard to read for me personally, and kind of ruins a little bit of the charm. I wish there were some AA, filter, or CRT options in the game to try because I think they'd help with the parsing issue a little bit for me.\n\nI lost where Anton & Annie were all of the time. Often times I'll hit some blocks or an enemy and have to stand around for a half second just to check where I'm at, or risk running into something. The foreground gets in the way during the sections where you jump into the background so much it felt like I had hair in my eyes during them. Anton & Annie flash white when you're spinning around with their weapons making them surprisingly difficult to see whenever you hit literally anything. This combined with the previously mentioned screen crunch and the effects that pop up when you hit things leads to an experience that feels like it wants me to go fast but fights me at every turn visually. I feel like if I wanted to go fast I'd have to memorize the game, which at that point I may as well be a TAS bot if I'm just going to memorize inputs to get through something safely.\n\nThe game is absolutely stunning visually, but damn does it make it difficult to play for me. I think all of these problems/nitpicks could be fixed with a patch though. Add an accessibility option to highlight Anton/Annie with a thick black outline or to always keep them in front of the effects and I think most of my complaints will be a non issue.\n\nGameplay wise, I do , but the visual chaos brings down the gameplay with it. As mentioned, I often felt like I wanted to go fast but HAD to go slow constantly. Hitting enemies from landing would sometimes just launch me up in the air because the attack button also bounces you upwards if done in the air, and the timing is pretty generous for it. Anton/Annie have a surprising amount of inertia as well, meaning you often times will drift slightly too far or too short of where you wanted to land and have to try a few extra times. This isn't a problem most of the time, but the game often has little secrets and such that require you to bounce off boxes successfully, or repeat the entire level to try again. There are also times where you simply feel out of control of the characters. I wouldn't mind a \"try to get through a level perfectly\" sort of thing, but as far as I'm aware there isn't actually a prize or anything for it, so there isn't a point other than for self satisfaction (this could be user error here, maybe there is something and I just don't know). There's just a LOT of minor gameplay annoyances that I think you'll really feel if you're more familiar with platformers. If you're not, you'll probably only feel the screen crunch. I really enjoy the speed of the game, and I enjoy the general ideas at play here, but often times I found myself annoyed more than having fun.\n\nI really enjoy the chaos and destructiveness of the gameplay, but I feel so out of control sometimes that it backfires and I stop enjoying it as much. TBH all I can really summarize it as is \"I feel mixed\". I love hitting things, but I also hate how I bounce around like a rubber ball. I love dashing through enemies, but I hate that I can barely see myself after hitting one, so I mash attack and bounce accidentally, or get hit. I love the impact effects, but I can't see anything. It's just a constant back and forth for me.\n\nA quick word on the bosses, I just kind of found them annoying. I ran into two of them. The game is split into (minor structure spoiler) . The first boss I ran into was funny looking, but I constantly felt like I was getting caught by attacks that I reacted to. I felt like I had to give the boss a crazy amount of room or I'd just get locked into a command grab from smash bros. The hitboxes just felt a bit off. The second boss I ran into was, simply put, a cluster \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. Just constantly smacking the hell out of him while enemies that felt like they didn't belong showed up. I enjoyed the second half of the boss a bit better, but I still found myself annoyed. The bosses look cool, are tough, but a bit frustrating.\n\nThere's also a LOT of little QoL annoyances. I bought the hat for example and legit thought my game was busted for around 10-20 minutes because of the weird black border at the top. It was kind of funny when I realized it, but I was more disappointed like \"oh, I just wasted all of that money, and I don't get an actual hat\" more than \"ha, that's a funny joke\". The disappointment left me assuming that all the other items like it would do something dumb to the screen as a bit - meaning they all were worthless in my head now. I bought the TV as well, and it felt like a waste of my in game cash. I don't mind little decorations and jokes, I \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 love decorating, but I guess I was just annoyed that these things were so useless for the cost (maybe they're cooler later).\n\nThe additional skins also are in a vertical linear list of like 50-100 items (I don't remember the exact number) which means you've gotta SCROLL to find the one you might want.\n\nLevels are scattered everywhere with no indicators of where they're at other than memory and the initial black fog. This led to me getting a bit lost when I'd look away for a moment after beating a level and not know where the new level just opened up. If you want to change characters or costumes you also have to run back to the doors at the every time - which isn't the worst but it's also just kind of a time waster.\n\nLast pedantic complaint, I think one of the rooms you unlock after the first boss is a kickstarter backer avatar area or something? It's huge, I didn't know wtf it was when I was in it (still don't), and it just felt strangely out of place (and glitchy). I don't mind showing off who backed your game, but I was just left a bit confused after finding it - and dissapointed because it wasn't anything substantial for me.\n\nOverall, I'm just mixed on the game. I like the visuals, gameplay, and music, but there's so many little things adding up to annoy me that it's difficult for me to say I enjoyed it. I refunded the game and plan on buying it after a few patches on a sale, I would personally recommend you wait for a few patches as well. A of my issues can be fixed with patches and would easily flip over to positive if done."

        "review": "I've always been a platformer fan. When I saw this game's kickstarter trailer, I was extremely excited. I played every demo from this game and every time the game became better and better. Now that the final product is out, I gotta say, this is a blast!\nBombastic soundtrack, wacky and fluid spritework and animation, amazing level design, and fun gameplay! This game has everything an action platformer should have.\n\nBut the game is far from perfect!\n\n1. The sheer chaos: I love some chaos, don't get me wrong, but to the point that I don't understand whats happening on screen, and then getting punished for it is frustrating. This is especially obvious with the ball transformation. You just explode so much and dash way to fast to the point that its hard to follow even where I'm at. This is also a problem in boss level, especially the main bosses and final boss. They occupy so much space on the screen and have so many flashy attacks, I just get lost in the chaos.\n\n2. The levels: Every level is fantastic and fresh, but they go for so long, especially the hell levels. I don't know if this is a skill issue, but Hell Manor took me an hour and a half to BEAT. I'd rather if a game had small memorable levels, rather than long and tedious levels. I kept having that feeling where I would get bored of a level and couldn't wait to finish it so I can move on to the next one. This is also a problem when it comes to Cracking levels. If I had to restart a level every time my combo ended, I think I would end up in a mental hospital in like 2 weeks. So yeah, I'm not completing this game\n\n3. The platforming: The game is bombastic and speedy, but the areas where I need to slow down and do some tight platforming are so infuriating. Anton and Annie don't have the best air control and their jumps feel heavy, so even tough this game is a platformer, its clear that the duo weren't made for jumping (especially in the Crash Bandicoot crate jumping areas).\n\n\nIn conclusion: This game is clearly made for hardcore platformer lovers and its a clear love letter to some old-school platformer franchises like Crash Bandicoot and Wario Land, and its safe to say that this game isn't for everyone. But this game clearly is a polished, action-packed, bombastic adventure trough and trough."

In Antonblast, I panicked as I hastily scoured the lobby area in an attempt to find Paul, but when I finally played the first level, that's when I found him.\n\nHis iconic appearance in Antonblast is a highlight of the game, and it pays awesome homage to the classics, showing that even triple AAA developers like Summitsphere still care about their fans and appreciate the classics as much as we do. Thank you, Paul!"

        "review": "The game is only good for the first 3 levels (ignoring the first boss fight.) The demos' levels were the best parts of the final game. The rest of the game has very boring level design, and the camera constantly makes you run into things that make you take damage. It was a struggle to get through the last 3 levels because they were some of the least fun platforming levels I've ever played in a game.\nAnton's movement is also consistently slippery, making it incredibly ridiculous when they expect you to do perfect precise platforming in the middle of a run where you have to constantly spam the \"keep running\" button on time or else you lose all speed. The game would be like 20% better if running was a toggle, or the dash button just made you keep running until you stopped holding the direction key.\nThe bosses are the worst part of the game, with them all essentially being the strategy of just memorizing their attacks and then tanking whatever damage you just can't bother with anymore. Many, especially the final boss, also last for far too long than necessary, which seems to be an attempt at making them more climactic but just makes them go on long after the boss has lost its novelty.\nThe game is also incredibly cluttered. There are so many particles, projectiles, and random clusters of enemies all on screen at once. At some point, you just get tired of running through it all and taking damage you can't see in time to where you just start going through each level as mindlessly as possible because it's just too overwhelming to handle.\nThe controls are also very frustrating to deal with because the \"hammer attack\" button. The same button to do your dash is the same button to do the hammer spin. This makes the mistake of accidentally spinning when trying to dash while landing far too common to be seen as something the developers couldn't have noticed in playtesting.\nOf course, everything besides what I've mentioned is great. The art style is charming, the soundtrack is alright, and the story is pretty funny. However, the gameplay itself is so annoying to play that I wish I didn't try to stick it out to the end to form my opinion because maybe I could have gotten a refund. I don't recommend this game at all. Instead of buying, just go watch some \"All Cutscenes\" video on youtube to save your time, money, and smile on your face."

Hell whenever I finally got my laptop and my Steam account the Dynamite Demo was the first thing I installed on it, and while I understood why... I was pretty heartbroken by the delay, even if it was only a month... My point is I've waited a long time for the full game and it has (no pun intended) been a blast and has been worth all the wait! Seeing all the new levels not shown in the demos was a huge surprise, and the more I replay all of them the more they grow on me, I'm serious there isn't a bad level in this thing.\n\nI really need to stress that Antonblast is absolutely worth your time, it's got just enough content for a casual player to be left satisfied by it, and enough incentive for the 100% and the speedruns (which I'm currently trying to route.) It's got excellent challenge that will certainly humble those who aren't ready, but it never kicks you so hard you don't want to get up, and alongside it's gameplay comes it's sense of humor which... Frankly is right up my alley, it's certainly not ashamed of who it is and that's the best in my eyes.\n\nMy only gripe with Antonblast is that I didn't go in with a clear mind. I wasn't prepared for the new levels and that set me off guard. I felt mixed for a good minute due to both my... admitted post work grogginess, and overall unfamiliarity. Thankfully after another run through (or two) I've learned to love every level and I'm struggling to pick a favorite...\n\nIn closing. It's was worth the wait, It's worth your time, It's worth your money, and It's certainly worthy of a drink. It's Happy Hour!"

        "review": "A masterpiece of a platformer, and one of the most deranged (in a good way) games I've ever played.\n\nAlmost every single stage is brimming with creativity, fun gimmicks, and unique enemy designs. With an explosive flair to boot, you could classify Antonblast as a \"destruction platformer\", with a focus on flashy, bombastic visuals and destroying as many obstacles that stand in your path. The simple act of traversal is, in of itself, an explosive power trip. Despite the frantic intensity of Anton's wanton destruction, the controls are surprisingly easy to get used to, and once you're a hour or two into the game, the controls feel silky-smooth and VERY intuitive, I never felt as if my inputs were dropped or that the controls were acting unresponsive.\n\nTo top off the wonderful level design, Antonblast has an absolutely STELLAR lineup of boss fights, which are all enjoyable in their own right - the strongest being the 4 World Bosses at the end of each respective world, which I would personally consider some of the best in the platforming genre. The second World Boss in particular (Fourth in the entire lineup) is, quite frankly, stunning, and even once the recency bias settles, it will most likely be one of my favorite platformer bosses of all time. Do be warned, though - some of the later bosses are bullet hells in their own right, and do NOT pull any punches.\n\nOh, and for the record - the music slaps. Hard. Every track is oozing with flair, and while some songs are certainly more memorable than others, the soundtrack simply never gets old. And to top it all off, the spritework in this game is absolutely BEAUTIFUL, with a 90s Cartoon Network-esque charm that makes the game incredibly appealing to the eyes.\n\nFor any fan of fast-paced platformers, and/or those who are particularly big fans of games like Crash Bandicoot, Rayman, Donkey Kong Country, and especially Warioland, this game is an absolute must-play and one of the best indie platformers on the market. 20 Dollarydoos is an absolute bargain.\n\nNote - If you are sensitive to flashing lights, screenshake, the like, there is a photosensitivity mode in the game's settings, and you are given the option to disable screenshake entirely if you so desire."

        "review": "This game is SO worth the twenty dollars and honestly it deserves more. If you've seen or played Pizza Tower, you may think that ANTONBLAST is some kind of game inspired by Pizza Tower. While being mostly similar in terms of 90's styled cartoony absurdity, ANTONBLAST takes inspiration from Wario Land 4, much like Pizza Tower. This game is very challenging so if you thought Pizza Tower wasn't hard enough, this is for you. It has a great story, amazing gameplay, stunning visuals, an artstyle that keeps on giving, various transformations and/or mechanics that never get boring, and so many collectibles along with a wide variety of color unlockable color palettes. 10/10 indie game."

The gameplay is chaotic, intense, and fun, while also being pretty darn challenging (I mean it's a Crash Bandicoot inspired game so difficulty is to be expected). The soundtrack is an absolute jam, with my personal favorite track being Pane and Heartache. The jagged, sharp, graffiti like artstyle is very cool and unique, the characters are very charming and lovable, there's plenty of hilarious jokes and gags, there's a dang scream button! What's not to love?"

        "review": "Playing Antonblast is like watching an up-and-coming performer. The act is practiced and well-executed, fumbles a little towards the end but sticks the landing, and ultimately you feel truly blessed to have witnessed it.\n\nThe opening act of Antonblast is strong! It's the sort of platforming you've seen before, but it's fast and it hints at small details for those willing to look for it. You don't have to go that deep, what's present at the surface level is entertaining and fully enjoyable! That high energy follows into the first boss battle which - uniquely for platformer bosses - is quite challenging! Pattern recognition is important, and as you try and try again, you get better. And by the end, you don't feel like you were just waiting for the big glowing weakpoint to appear. Okay, maybe you are, but it's an enjoyable \"wait\".\n\nAs Antonblast continues, each level is revealed in spectacular fashion, each has a unique identity and focuses on different mechanics. There are no stinkers in this level pool! And the bosses continue to be just as challenging and memorable! Maybe you want to go back and retry one of those earlier levels now that you've gotten better at hammer jumping? If so, you realize just how well Antonblast has been designed for SPEED. Dash into dash, into hammer jump, into clutch boost... The layers beneath the surface get revealed...\n\nTowards the end, Antonblast begins asking more from you. The levels get longer and the reaction times you need to showcase become tighter. The controls fight back a little. You start dying more and realizing just how vital those checkpoints are. You then remember that there's a time trial and chain mode which involve going through these levels without dying... And then you realize just how often you're dying. By the end, Antonblast's difficulty has skyrocketed and it says if you're not able to meet the challenge, it's time to Get Gud. Mercifully there's adaptive difficulty in places, more checkpoints when your skill is lacking. Antonblast is beatable, and a cathartic experience... But the sheer difficulty spike towards the end - the final boss especially - is staggering.\n\nHowever, at no point is Antonblast boring. And never does it ask more of you than you can give. If you're willing to practice, learn, and persevere, the challenges can be conquered. And then there are more challenges digging deeper into what the game has to offer. So many things. To those looking to master it, Antonblast has so much that it's willing to share. And it will always be willing to entertain you if you're willing to meet it halfway.\n\nI can't easily recommend Antonblast. There is a skill gate later in (though as of writing the final level is getting some further balancing) so those who aren't great at platformers are going to reach a wall. And even if you are great at speedy platformers there's a lot to perfect. Thus if you're curious about Antonblast, I would highly recommend playing the demo as it has the first two levels. If you have a great time with that, then Antonblast is worth giving a shot. If you think you're going to like Antonblast, then you will love it. It's a tough love though."

It feels fun to grind out some chips from time to time on deck! Post game is good too! Ost is jamming and might be my favorites of all time!\n\nThe game isn\u2019t perfect though. The difficulty feels like it\u2019s asking too much of the player at times, it feels unfair at worst and hard at best. The Hammer Bounce is the worst at times, it needs to be mapped to a different button or something, the amount of times I\u2019ve accidentally did the move was staggering!! The final Paul challenge is hell.\n\nThat being said the efforts are rewarding once you complete them, I do hope they make an easier difficulty option and let you map the hammer bounce move on different buttons!"

        "review": "One of the best platformers I have played this year. Antonblast is to Late 90s/Early 2000s Cartoon Network what Pizza Tower is to 90s Nickelodeon. Its loud, its bombastic, its over the top, and it carries a clear swagger that permeates through the entire game. While its easy to make a lot of Pizza Tower comparisons, Antonblast manages to do enough differently to establish its own identity. Few other games I have played in recent memory ooze such labor of love all over. Summitsphere poured every ounce of their blood, sweat, and tears into this project and it shows with the myriad of easter eggs and secrets abound to reward dedicated players. And this is all on top on the myriad of alternate color schemes to collect where are like a reference hunt in themselves. In terms of difficulty the game isn't the hardest I have played but be warned the later stages can and will test you especially if you are aiming for 100% completion\n\nAntonblast is without a doubt has become one of my top contendors for game of the year and is an absolute must play for any Wario Land fan\n\n10/10 would blast again"

        "review": "Note: I will not be comparing this game to any other comparable games that came out in, let's just say arbitrarily, January 26th, 2023.\n\nAntonblast is a game I love a lot more than I like.\n\nThis is a game that had a relatively short development time and is able to condense a lot of fun, inventive ideas into twelve short levels and nine bosses. The manic gameplay encourages you to fling yourself around without a care in the world and smash everything you come across into teeny-tiny little pieces. The game is at its best when its novelty is on full display.\n\nThe game is at its worst when it requires precision.\n\nAntonblast is not nearly as precise as a platformer as it thinks it is. There are very few methods of canceling moves into each other in a manner I'd call graceful, but oftentimes the game and its bosses are designed as if you have precise control over Anton/Annie. Additionally, your clutch attack will often bounce you back, which is not commonly a problem in standard gameplay but is tremendously annoying in certain bosses where attempting to strike a weakpoint will result in you being bounced into an attack.\n\nThe game's visual noisiness, while a strong part of its personality, is also a contribution to some issues with the gameplay. I had to turn screen shake off entirely in order to focus on certain attacks and platforming sections. However, the visual noise and general lack of clarity with certain aspects such as invincibility/vulnerability windows means that I'm still not sure when I'm invincible during a hammer jump. There were frequent times where I would be doing a hammer jump and would harmlessly bounce off an enemy, while others times I would take damage without any clear distinction between an enemy's states. Either that, or they would enter the state so quickly that I couldn't adjust properly in time to avoid the attack. This was often an issue during clutches, which I would frequently need to use for mobility purposes, as its hard to stop a clutch once it actually begins.\n\nBut I'm being a bit hard on this game, I think. There's a lot to love here. Even the title screen itself, with the game screaming at you, followed by the delightful slapstick opening animation, are able to convey a grimy, late 90's and early 2000's energy that is completely and utterly wonderful to experience firsthand. The game's personality is easily its biggest selling point, and levels are frequently peppered with moments of hilarity that are completely unrelated to the actual gameplay that make me feel like I'm playing a cartoon. The little opening segments with Satan, the moments where Danton randomly appears in a level and you get to kill him, the hilarious imps and their dialogue, and the various setpieces that you frequently destroy as you progress through each level all help make this game a riot.\n\nHowever, Antonblast is a game I could only play in short blasts--err, bursts. It's hard to get into a flow state with the game and I think the levels should've been designed around your controls better. The inventive gameplay can't quite overcome a slow boiling frustration with controls and hitboxes.\n\nYou'll find a nice collection of spirits behind the bar. There's a lot of fun, fruity cocktails, some of the drinks have a real kick, and the guy working the place has a real fun personality. However, I couldn't just sit there and drink all night. Even just three drinks down I'd start noticing the weirdly grimy, bitter taste in the brew, and I'd have to head out mostly sober, which is a real shame.\n\nIt must be the satanic aura all around the place...\n\nOh well. Drink responsibly."

        "review": "Consider it aas a very brief opinion of mine...\n\nI was extremely excited to finally play the full release of Antonblast after waiting for a month or two.\nAnd I have to say and praise the strongest side it has, which are: its energy, creativity, originality; its artstyle and visuals are amazing, platforming at times fun and challanging, and so are brief puzzles and overall concept of it, being a love letter to WarioLand4, specifically its energy.\n\nHowever, the issues in question, in my opinion, come down to, generally, style over gameplay, and either that hurricane or smth else made that the game near the end kind of starts to look slightly worse.. ? Like the ending cutscene looking clunky.\nElaborating, from what I have noticed, most of these issues could be fixed easily with just one thing. For example: sometimes the camera moving alongside player and enviroment make it extremely hard to see what is happening and what comes ahead, as one can see in pinball sections in its level. I bet if the camera was fixed to moving up and down these major rooms, instead of alongside player, and was zoomed out, these would be wayyyy better! Plus the platforming is at times very annoying..\n\nThough it does not mean the game is trash nor anything like that. Other than (hot take) 2 last levels, every level is fun, creative and oozes with originality! Especially the pool one, which caught me off guard... and so did every level. Exploring them for first time (and continously dying) was both frustrating and fun!\nThe visuals are at their best though! Cant really tell a single thing that was done badly, other than final cutscene? Platforming, even though sometimes frustrating, is also engaging and satisfying once you get it all right!\nAnd how could I forget about its humor, probably the most flawless part of this game! It just shows how devs had tons of fun while making this game, which is why I love it!\nI always awe experimental games like this one. It just shows how much effort people put into it, and in the end, originality is always welcomed!\n\nOverall, rough around the edges, which is a shame cuz I am fully sure they put everything they could into making this game as best as possible, despite the hurricane!\nWhen it works though it REALLY does!\nAnd seeing the most recent patch that has been added, I think Summit is still polishing their work!\n\nStyle, energy and originality is what this game thrives at!\nAlthough style over gameplay is what bit this game a tiny bit in the tail, but if it wasnt for the style, then this game would have been... not Antonblast.\n\nSo... yeah, that's all for now!"

        "review": "So from my current experience, very nice, stylish, fun, good levels. But I do have some problems as well\n1. The character is way to wobbly to actually do precise platforming, for example bouncing on tiny boxes or moving platforms. Overall, he CAN move very nice through the chaos, but it doesn get odd when you slide around or he just keeps hammer bouncing on the floor, dispite you not pressing anything anymore. for example\n2. You can't use the hammer bounce to bounce on those boxes, wich WOULD be fine, but it would make your hitbox better for that platforming\n3. Many parts need you to utilize the stuff in the area, wich DON'T respawn unless you reset to checkpoint. Really annoying\nSo as you saw, so far mostly the same area of problem\nThe first boss so far was fun and nice! Even if it was a thing of \"just dodge until he stays in place and vulnerable\" wich does knock it down a peck\n\nBut yea, these were just my first two hours, and I DID try to collect everything so far (wich didn't work yet)\nWill still recommend, especially if you just wanna play and have fun. I can see the passion, still feels nice to play, lot's of charm. So keep it going! And give it a play! I am pretty sure so far, it is definetly worth the money."

        "review": "It's a BLAST!!!\n\n...Obvious pun aside, this game does a fantastic job at reviving the Wario Land (and even a bit of Crash Bandicoot) formula and putting its own spin on it. The visual style has a certain vibe to it that screams \"you're gonna wreak some havoc today\", and the music is consistently catchy from start to finish.\n\nI do have some small gripes about this game: The difficulty accelerates VERY quickly, but can be managed through trial and error. Also, on the note of difficulty, the game barely gives any semblance of hints as to where collectibles are-- which I do feel could be improved on for completionists like me.\n\nEven still, Antonblast, as a game, proves that it can stand tall among indie video games, and even some of the giants who forged the industry. If you like fast-paced \"High Voltage Screaming Action\", you'll love this!\n\nRANKING: 9/10"

Fast, challenging, incredibly well done aesthetic, every single piece of this game comes together to make it something special.\n\nThe comparisons to Pizza Tower are obvious (both fast-paced Wario Land inspired platformers with a 90's cartoon feel, and the post-game combo chain mode definitely feels familiar), but don't go into it expecting the same thing - this game plays VERY differently, and is arguably a lot more challenging."

A fantastic game at the core, elevated by it's masterful execution.\n\nEvery element of the game comes together harmonically, every idea, every obstacle, every part of the level design is crafted carefully to make one of the greatest feeling 2D platformers of all time. The levels reward coming back and looking deeper within, while also being incredible to speed through. The stages have a certain flow to them, which pushes you in the right direction. The secrets are places that feel rewarding to discover, instead of punishing you for not memorising the stage. Completion feels rewarding and not like a chore. The boss fights feel dynamic, as many of them are designed in a way to reward risky moves, allowing you to damage them independently of their attack pattern, instead of just waiting for them to become vulnerable, like the platformer genre has commonly done for years.\n\nNever before have I seen a video game that simultaneously wears it's inspirations so proudly, yet never feeling like it's just referencing something you might remember. It's so creative, so full of passion, every idea is it's own and unique, even if rooted in something that the creators enjoyed.\n\nThe sensory stimulation gives an incredible feeling. I don't think I've ever had a game send so many different chemicals to my brain whilst playing. Both on the surface level in the form of visuals and sound design, to the incredible feeling of the gameplay and stage design, which you may not even pay attention to unless you think about it.\n\nI fully recommend ANTONBLAST, it is worth every penny, even at full price. It is one of the greatest 2D platformers of all time.\n\nTo get the full experience I would advise looking up videos of the game, as it may spoil you on the many surprises awaiting. Summitsphere did a great job by not showing everything the game has in promotional material and letting the player discover. It keeps you on your toes."

It's surprisingly difficult, and the controls are extremely difficult to get accustomed to. The game also doesn't often do a good job of explaining key mechanics or telegraphing danger, so it can feel like a lot of trial and error.\n\nOverall, it will lead to you getting your ass handed to you easily when you first start playing and it not feeling like your fault 90% of the time. The controls will feel extremely unsatisfying at first.\n\nSo if you're extremely impatient and get angry extremely easily, I can't exactly say in good faith that you'll enjoy the experience. And if you're coming into this game having just played Pizza Tower like I was... yeah, you're in for a rough time.\n\nIt was such a bad first impression, in fact, that I originally left a strongly-worded negative review on the game and refunded it after playing for only half an hour.\n\nHOWEVER. After re-buying the game (because I had nothing better to do) and gritting through the miserable beginning, I have to say:\n... Well, I still don't think the gameplay is great (though I haven't finished the game yet), but I guess it's good enough once you get used to it. Overall, I'd probably still rather play Pizza Tower? But it's a nice change of pace.\nAnd everything else makes up for it.\n\nThe game looks gorgeous\nIt's one of the funniest games I've ever played\nQuite possibly the single best OST I've ever heard\n\nUhhh... yeah I dunno really what else to say. It's good. Not the best game I've ever played (it's not even close lol), but it's more than good enough."

There's so much care put into this game and it's so fun to BLAST your way through levels as fast as possible. But even with that said, if you're coming in here expecting this to play just like Pizza Tower, you've got the wrong idea. They're both similar but Antonblast is closer to Wario Land 4 even though they're both heavily inspired by it. There's some Crash Bandicoot inspiration as well so there's going to be some precise platforming. But that doesn't mean the gameplay is slow. You can still pull things off really fast and show off your speed. The main form of movement called the clutch boost feels awesome to do and combining it with hammer bounces and more makes it even better especially if you pull it off right. There's also many incredible transformations to spice up the gameplay as well. This game is just a BLAST from start to finish and I highly recommend checking it out if you love chaotic speedy fun with a banger soundtrack"

It's legitimately amazing, it's music and level design is some of my favorite stuff from indie games, the characters are all really funny, and like it ticks a huge box of being a shoutout to games nostalgic while also being it's own thing. As a massive Crash Bandicoot fan, I can see how much Tony loves that series, and it shows, but this also stands on it's own, with much more to explore in the levels and how it pushes its presentation in all kinds of good ways.\n\nI'd say this game is not for the faint of heart though, and I'm not talking about the butts and booze. While it is playable to anyone of any skill level (I do not consider myself particularly skilled at games) it will test you and gets hard very fast, but the endorphins you get from beating something hard are immense. Going to be worth it when I get it on switch as well!"

But one flaw, ONE flaw that brings the game down is the difficulty. I like when games are easy enough to enjoy and challenging enough to retain that enjoyment.\n\nBut this game can be so hard and irritating which is something that makes me not happy. Because when games are like that, it's more fun to watch, then to play, and that's not good. So I ask, could you perhaps, add some kind of difficulty system. So this painful gameplay is behind a hard mode, and a more enjoyable version is in a normal mode. The game is great, and would love to beat it. But I would like to have fun while doing. Overall great job on releasing this fantastic humorous platformer."

The art style is great, it's very sharp and edged, well animated I love it. If you like fast paced platformers like Pizza Tower and Sonic Mania you'll most likely like this game too. The story is short but AWESOME, its story is CRAZY it has \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Satan stealing spirits from a random dude because hes more red than him. I love how this game does not take itself that seriously. The only REAL issue with this game in my opinion is that it my be a little overwhelming, I can personally handle it but it can be a hurdle for someone trying to get into this game. I my other complains are nitpicks or a skill issue lol.\n\nIn conclusion I may have a few nitpicks but no game is perfect and I still LOVE this game a funny story, cool characters, fast paced gameplay, amazing bosses, and a banger soundtrack. I HIGHLY recommend this game show Summitsphere some support pls. This game is my personal Game of the Year"

Bosses take way to long and expect you to not only memories patterns on the fly but to react without much notice. And not that many levels despite looking massive. I would rather have way more shorter level than few long levels that out last their welcome and give you only one chance for a secret and force you to do the whole stage over just to try again."

AntonBlast!\n\nWhile many people can compare the two, I like how both stand out. But this is an Anton review, so the rest of this is a review of it.\n\nAntonBlast is simple. Get your spirits back and destroy every level! Along the way, look for treasure, spray cans, and music tapes to spice things up and make you look everywhere. Anton is the perfect game for those who want to find everything a level offers. Combined with gameplay, that's a hybrid or a racing game via the clutch system and a platformer; it's hard to learn but easy to master. But if you can handle it, you'll destroy these levels faster than ranking up a tab at Brulo's.\n\nAnd don't even mention the awesome bosses. I won't spoil them, but they're a damm blast to beat the snot out of. If you're still on the fence, try the demo. And if you want more, well...THEN BUY THE GAME!"

The game wears its Wario Land 4 and Crash Bandicoot inspirations on its sleeve, and the game both makes you feel like a destructive, kinetic force of nature, and rewards you for taking your time to explore in equal parts. The boss fights are fun, the OST by Tony Grayson is INCREDIBLE, and every other review brings this all up! But. . .\n\nThe game is also \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 hilarious.\n\nI'm struggling to put it into words without spoiling anything. But I've had to stop playing for a minute or two just to finish completely losing it over some bit of slapstick or dialogue once or twice.\n\nThis game is . If you like platformers, 20 bucks USD is an absolute steal."

The gameplay is fast paced, the bosses are creative, and the only real issue I have so far is with one of the bosses. There are 2 types of bosses, normal ones with healthbars, and minibosses with their own cards. The miniboss of the third floor kinda sucks. It's not even that the boss is that bad, but playing it is annoying. This is because minibosses don't have checkpoints. This is fine for the others, but its bad for this one because the boss is SO LONG. Every time you die, you have to go through SO MUCH just to get back to where you were, only to die there again and have to spend another like 5 minutes going through the same repetitive stuff to get back. Other than that (and the mall level) this game's great!"

If you're looking for a game that's kinda like Pizza Tower or are a fan of challenging (and/or) speed based platforming, I would say Antonblast is a must try. As a massive platformer fan I have to say that this game and Pizza Tower are tied for what I can only describe as the best platforming experience I've ever had. This game is a masterpiece, I have almost no complaints about it or warnings for anyone who's just starting the game besides the game can be pretty challenging sometimes and watch out for the pinball stage. That's really it. Pinball stage is more just trial and error than anything so take that as you will.\n\nI guess I'm kind of biased because this game seems like something that came straight from the imagination of someone just like me, which is why I have to give it a 1000000000/10. The game I wouId say this is closest to is Yoshi's Island or Donkey Kong Country, but there are references to a billion different games and cartoons within this masterpiece. This game was definitely a labor of love and it shows in pretty much every aspect of the game. Please get it if it seems appealing at all to you (I would say at least try the demo but they REMOVED IT for some reason.....)"

        "review": "I'm a proud backer of this game, I tried to set aside all bias in my review, but I still absolutely would recommend it.\n\nAn incredibly unique game that just oozes with charm. The style of gameplay is a bit weird at first but I really came to love it when I got the hang of it, I really enjoyed the unorthodox movement mechanics. The music is extremely catchy and the art and animation are outstanding! The production value here from the relatively small team is nothing short of impressive.\n\nIf I have any criticism to give: I think the hub world is a bit clunky, the music is a real earworm but it's kinda sluggish to navigate. I think the randomized elements of the late game bosses could be adjusted, sometimes it felt like my deaths were unfair. I'm mixed on the collectables, I found almost none of them in my first playthrough, partly because there is no incentive to pick them up (aside from some skins). On one hand I like that they're fully optional, on the other I feel like there could have been some kind of more substantial reward for getting them.\n\nAs of writing this, it is not Steam-Deck verified, but I encountered very few issues and only a couple bugs."

        "review": "A actual blast that really dose Wario Land 3 some justice\n\nAnton blast is a exploding action pack game bent on putting a big dumb grin on face. Not only dose the game carry a foul mouthed demolitionist but also his air headed roommate who's just glad to hit things. Anton or Annie handle really sharp (save for in the air) and really do carry a heavy presence on the screen, witch is great when everything is exploding or going insane on screen. The character skins hold some of the best references I have ever had the privilege of seeing (it has a small range from memes, video games, and cartoons from the 2000's).\n\nThe levels are a mix of hard and fun, I would have to compare it to ether running a hammer through a REALLY big china shop or pushing a big bedazzled rock like Sisyphus up a really bumpy floor, all while some insanely dam good tracks play to keep your spirits up. I mean the music is just amazing like HOOOOLY I never wanted some of the levels to end just so I could listen to the track more, or have a few more minutes to listen to It's Happy Hour (escape theme) a bit longer.\n\nThe bosses are something else, like a whole other creature in a good way. Changing the focus from running and bashing to a dodging... and blasting. It really dose boil down to \"just smack them\" for a majority of the fights, but when one makes you work for it \"YOU WORK FOR IT\".\n\nAll and all this game kicks actual ass and I can't recommend it enough\n\nThanks for reading\n\nP.S. Please add the OST to the store I really love this music"

        "review": "So, yes, this game has a ton of cool stuff in it and alot of great ideas, but my one major complaint is how the game itself feels. it doesn't feel very beginner-friendly, as if it expects everyone playing to have already done the demos over and over and built up a huge tolerance to how the game feels. Theres an optional sort-of-a-secret platforming challenge room in level 2 that took me an entire hour to try and finish, and it didnt even have a collectible at the end of it. it was just a bunch of chips (the currency of the game.)\n\nthe worst part about my other, nameless irks with the game is that they can't likely be patched out or anything. they'd require fundamental changes to the game, it's levels, and it's physics as a whole. i seldom ever feel like im in total control of anton, and now that we have other contemporaries in its field (yes im talking about pizza tower of course im talking about pizza tower) there isnt much value in a game of this style where i dont feel like im comfortable with the way the game handles, since we already have a game that does that way better (and for less money.)\n\nits a cool game with good ideas. it just feels like \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 to actually play."

        "review": "I love this game and I plan to play it a few more times, but there are many gripes that I have that soured the experience enough for me to try to discuss them online. I just hope that Tony and his team are made aware of some of these issues so Anton Blast and Summit's future projects get the recognition they deserve.\n\nI'll try to be concise:\n\n1. Audio Mixing - I constantly found myself adjusting the sound settings because the sound effects and music really fight for your attention, it's hard to hear both at the same time and the default settings do not sound right (on headphones at least).\n\n2. Visual Clarity - This problem is worse in the earlier levels, the resolution and screen space are limited (I think it matches the GBA), and the levels are detailed so often times the general readability of the level layouts are difficult to process given the speed of the game. In the later levels this is less of an issue because the color palettes are more limited and the platforming challenges have more space between them (tighter jumps).\n\n3. Screen Shake and Camera Lerping - The camera moves VIOLENTLY in this game to really emphasize the power and speed of the player. Even after turning the camera shake down I was still struggling to keep my eyes on Anton in certain levels. This may be the worst in the segments where Anton transforms into a bomb and bounces around so quickly that the camera does not keep up. I've played a lot of high speed action games in my life and was still getting disoriented. I think the camera should try to keep Anton a little closer to the center of screen so players feel like their mistakes are something they have time to avoid.\n\nDespite these issues, I am really impressed with the game overall, the art and music are incredible, the levels are distinct, and I think the passion of the devs flows from the screen like it should. The game MIGHT be a little too difficult but that topic is subjective."

        "review": "The chaotic gameplay and art style sells it for me. I have 400 hours on Pizza Tower, so of course I was gonna buy this game, and I am not dissapointed. I love how which character you play as, you get different dialogue and cutscenes. Sometimes there is so much stuff getting blasted on screen, that I have no clue what is happening, but that just adds to the chaos. I also love how retro the game looks, like it actually looks like an old computer game from the 90s. Yeah I totally recommend, I think its worth the price, it has a lot of replayability."

Insanely great level design, amazing soundtrack, extremely responsive controls, all while maintaining an amazing art style and fun character designs. When it come to the Wario like games, I've often had problems with the skill required to 100% the game, or get a lot of challenges done. With AntonBlast though, they've made it where speed or combos are entirely optional, making it where I can play the game at my own pace, and THEN go and speedrun it after I scope things out. So happy to see Summitsphere make such an incredible game, and I can't wait to see whatever they come up with next!"

        "review": "This game is freaking AWESOME, everything I would really want in a Warioland successor and more! The artstyle is very appealing, the story and characters are charming, and the gameplay is great!\n\nAll of the levels are all unique and fun to play through, with their own interesting and varying gimmicks. (Except maybe Pinball Mire, I can't tell if the level is difficult/janky or I'm bad at video games).\n\nMy favorite levels are definitely Big Bath and Mad Mall, expertly-designed levels imo\nDefinitely excited to tackle replaying the levels through time attack and combo chain, adds a lotta replayability!!\n\nAnton/Annie feel great to control as well!! I struggled a little bit with how they moved at first, but once you get the hang of how they play, WOW they're fluid. I've seen some friends be able to pull some wicked \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 with their movement haha.\n\nIf I had to give any gripes about my experience; The hub to me is a little finicky to maneuver around in, and I do wish the palettes were easier to navigate around, it's a little slow with how it's done and I gotta mash to look thru them (I would suggest maybe being able to hold up/down, or maybe pressing left/right to go to the next available if unlocked!)\n\nAlso, I feel like the third boss wasn't very fun at all. It was very slow feeling at the start, then devolved into WAY too much going on that I just struggled and probably won't find myself replaying / dread having to replay in the future.\n\n\n\nI've been having nothing but pure fun playing ANTONBLAST, a definitive 8/10 experience. I do hope some of these issues can be resolved, considering I hear work will still be done with the game in the future! Definitely excited for more content being added for it too, cause I know when I truly do EVERYTHING I can, I'm totally gonna be itching for more!!!\n!! Just needs more polish all around, but it definitely doesn't detract of the overall experience (Other than the previous stated gripes ofc haha)"

        "review": "A visual blast overselling spiraling levels which don't always explain puzzles, and simple fights due to restrictive player movesets. While a strong start the experience steadily devolves with visual clutter hampering a feel of progression, both for player satisfaction and the 100% incentive as Anton Blast's inspirations lead the end product to feel somewhat aimless but still enjoyable.\n\n(For a similar and somewhat niche alternative I'd recommend Super House of Dead Ninjas)"

Following the game as closely as I could, any and all expectations I had for this game were completely blown out of the water. Amazing level design, although difficult at no point in my playthrough did any damage I took feel unfair, instead a punishment for going too fast in an unfamiliar place. Funny characters with funny dialogue, and amazing boss fights make this game stand out above other platformers. It doesn't just closely follow it's inspirations, but it appreciates and expands on them to create what feels like an entirely new concept. This game is pumped full of passion and I can't recommend it enough. ANTONBLAST, I love you"

        "review": "This game is a loving send up to the Warioland, Crash Bandicoot, and so much more and it oozes with a style of it's own the entire way through up to a wonderful finish. If you feel that games have been lacking in a specific kind of edge or have a fondness for golden age MTV this will have a place in your library. If you got kids and swear around them they'll probably like this too.\n\nI've only a few minor things I'd change or amend in some way, mainly that visual clarity can be something of an issue during the game's otherwise fantastic (and already very difficult!) ensemble of bosses, what with the intense screen shake and GBA hardware accurate sprite scaling combined with everything mostly sharing the same thick black outlines. Meaning everything from a projectile, rubble kicked up by the player character, and the boss itself can be left fighting for screen estate while you're frantically dodging for your life. Thankfully this seldom is an issue in standard levels but it does happen in at least one stage.\n\nThat aside this is a great way to spend 20 bucks and a few days beating, I look forward to more from this team regardless of how that takes shape."

Tiene niveles con gimmicks muy divertidas as\u00ed como geniales combates.\nEn cuanto a contenido principal hay 12 niveles y 8 peleas con jefes (de lo m\u00e1s divertidas y desafiantes).\nA\u00fan as\u00ed en mi primera blind playthrough me ha tomado alrededor de 7 horas.\nA\u00fan me quedan muchos secretos por encontrar y logros por obtener.\nPersonalmente si te gustan los plataformeros desafiantes y est\u00e1s buscando una experiencia fuera de lo habitual (hay pocos wariolikes por ahora) Antonblast es definitivamente tu juego.\n\n10/10"

I don't find them very fun, unlike the time trials, and that's because of one small reason. When losing a combo, you lose health. there are also no health crates in the level anymore. By itself, I think these are fun and challenging ways to replay these levels, but together it just gets really annoying. I can totally see someone having fun with this level of challenge, and for an optional challenge I can't really complain too much. I just wish I was able to enjoy this challenge more. I think keeping the damage on losing a combo and just having less health crates than normal would still be a fun challenge, but that's just me lol"

The game oozes charm at every corner and is one of the best games I have played recently.\n\nI love platformers and this game has hit an itch that I just cannot put down! I may have only done the first boss as of writing this, but the game gets hard and fast. And that's not a bad thing at all! I love it when games give you a good challenge and dares you to make some dangerous plays!\n\nI loved Pizza Tower, but this just hits differently. This and Pizza Tower, however; shouldn't really be compared to one another due to yes they have the same base inspiration they take it a completely different route.\n\nPizza Tower focuses on perfecting levels to get a perfect rank while Antonblast focuses on just being loud and blasting your balls off. I have not seen a game that is this loud from not only the audio but also it's personality."

        "review": "Honestly Antonblast didn't really live up to my expectations and has a couple of pretty big issues that I feel like need to be ironed out before you consider purchasing it. Just to name a few of the issues I've encountered: graphical bug in the mini boss rooms where the black explosion graphic is put over the screen around where the floor is making it hard to see both Anton and the boss, casino chips falling through platforms, the lightning cloud enemies still striking you with lightning after defeating them, a MASSIVE difficulty spike in the 3rd boss, and the last fetchquest in the 11th level being bugged and making it impossible for me to complete the level and by proxy finish the game. In my opinion anyone who is interested in this game should wait until all of these issues are resolved in a patch or a steam sale."

It comes out overtop of Sonic and Mario due to the fact that wario likes are my favorite platformers out there, and this game has been one of my most anticipated games in the last 10 years.\n\nControls are tight and responsive, Music is fantastic, level designs are amazing (artistically and functionally), the unlockable costumes are a joy to look at and use, voice acting and animation are top notch, transformations are snappy and chaotic, and the charm is completely off the charts.\n\nAntonBlast has been an absolute pleasure to play, and has brought me a ton of joy over the years. From the first demo I discovered it with, till the day it released, the blasting will never stop. The public demos were archived and are available on the Internet Archive if you wanna give that a shot before purchasing the whole thing. It's a great idea.\n\nThis game deserves every ounce of love it's getting, and I hope to see more projects from the team soon. Great work everyone, you killed it. <3\n\n10/10, Please give this game a try. You won't regret it one bit."

        "review": "This game has been in my periphery for the past howevermany years it was in development. I was anticipating this as the next great wario-like(?) (Its okay, I hate that name too) after Pizza Tower. I think it's not totally unfair to compare the two games on that end, even though that's doing both, but particularly antonblast a diservice. Antonblast has a strong essence all of its own. The gameplay is a lot more hectic than pizza tower, and often invites you to be as reckless as you can wager your hp on. There's no punishments for taking damage or moving slowly. Every timed section doesn't feel so much like a test of level memorization and mastery, and instead feels like a frantic scramble to the door as the world falls apart around you. I would liken this game's timer segments to the musical levels from Rayman Legends, if anything. This game also looks amazing. I loved it, cannot recommend it enough. I'm very proud of the indie scene for producing unique, quality platformers like these."

        "review": "I feel really bad for giving this a negative since I backed it, the game is hella crash bandicoot coated, been following the devs for a while, but like, man I am really forcing myself through this and after that last fight I don't think I can for a bit and I feel like I need to express what has been making me not enjoy it to help potentially smooth it out.\n\nGood things though because credit where credit is due, the things the game does right are amazing:\n-Fantastic visuals\n-Fantastic themeing\n-Fantastic music\n-Fantastic character design\n\nThe whole thing vibes wise is just charming as all hell i dont know what else to say there. You can really feel how much effort and passion went into this game. So much love for the crash bandicoot series too like wow, between the enemy mechanic design and the sound effects there's a lot of stuff I can immediately recognize having played those games. I respect that... which is exactly why it hurts so much to not be having fun with it\n\nThe first couple of levels are great, really lets you have fun with the games controls, have good flow to em. Really impressed at the scale of the levels tbh. Then the first miniboss is introduced and immediately a lot of what I feel like the game's persisting problems are crops up:\n\nThe game has some strange expectations of the player, and a sense of humor that's kinda funny in hindsight, but not so much to actually play through. A lot of obstacles hit you before you can even register due to the camera, visual effects, sound effects, and overall lack of distinction for some things that would normally help the player register they need to do or avoid something. A lot of the time it feels more like padding than difficulty I should be expected to learn from.\n\nI can't really say most levels are hard as they give you plenty of checkpoints, but they really REALLY like to waste your time by sucker punching you multiple times throughout long or even short segments of gameplay, expecting you to either remember they're all there AFTER you get hit or somehow just know they're coming despite the camera sometimes just holding in a place before lerping back to the player, trying to focus on two things at once, or just not being able to keep up with the speed the player wants to utilize and have. How was I supposed to know there was a nitro just offscreen, why was there a nitro just offscreen in the direction the game knew I'd be holding, why would you do this especially during gimmick sections like the jetpack where you can't snapily change your direction.\n\nI can tell the game has some good feel to it with it's base controls, but it does everything in it's power to make sure I either don't get to use them or get slapped in the face for daring to try. It feels like I have to fight the game for half of each level to just let me play it, in part due to the gimmicks and how unwieldy they are and how lengthy some of their segments can be on top of segments that automate you for a while and then spit you into quick reaction obstacles. I'm not opposed to the crazy gameplay shifts to give a player an experience or some spectacle moments to show something cool, but it gets to the point where I'll be sitting there not understanding what I'm doing, why it's happening, why I'm being punished by taking damage cause i physically cannot see whats on the screen, and how I'm expected to do it better when i end up dying in the middle of it. I get the game's called Anton BLAST but like I'd still like to play the game too. Visual clarity and informing the player on what they're dealing with is important... and I don't think the weird camera has anything to do with the blast part just like, please do SOMETHING with the camera to make it keep up better or show more of the stage.\n\nSome bosses telegraph their attacks pretty well, others telegraph them but there's a dozen things happening on the screen that you need to be aware of at the same time or are just there to distract you, some just kind of hit you with fire or aim lasers in a possition with either no time to react or happen to be possitioned in such a way that if you're in the wrong place you CANT get out of the way in time. You just kinda had to know not to be there. At least if the bosses didn't randomize their attack patterns (BELL), this wouldn't be as much of a problem on repeated attempts, but alas. Sometimes you are just going to take damage. The game does through HP your way to compensate for this, but it feels almost like a compromise rather than something to help you if you're struggling. Like, due to how fancy and flashy the bosses are, it'd be hard to change their attacks once they've been finalized, so instead of making sure the player could reasonably do something hitless, just give them more hp in case they do. There's probably a way to do these fights hitless. I do not want to.\n\nOn the note of perfecting and replaying levels, I also don't want to do that, despite the game being built more for exploration than something like pizza tower it feels. The lack of grading puts very little pressure on the player to rush through the stage, especially on their first attempt, which is actually really nice. Definitely more of the crash way to do it. However, this game has a LOT of secrets you can very easily miss on your first go through, because the window to react to getting them is so slim. This, again, would not normally be a problem, encouraging replayability is fine and all, but the game kinda drags you through the stages so much I really REALLY don't want to bother playing them again. Long stages are very impressive! However, long stages have a bit of an issue with replayability in that remembering everything you have to do is very tough, and blink and you'll miss it secrets and blink and you'll miss it obstacles like these mean that if you miss a secret or die, you're gonna have to go through all that again. Even between checkpoints it can be a bit of a drag sometimes.\n\nThere's even small nitpicks like switching between Anton and Annie requiring you to go to a specific room in the hub which if you do between levels like I do will take up a lotta time, same with palettes. The diegetic nature of it is cute, but why aren't there more swap points like Brulo's shop? Also god do i wish the game warned you better as to what buying the hat does, cause until I saw a bluesky post about it i thought that giant black mass of pixels covering my hud and various obstacles on the upper portion of the screen was a broken cutscene element that somehow persisted even when i reloaded the game. Funny in hindsight, but not when it comes at the cost of the players experience of the game. It wasn't obvious enough for me to get the joke, i just thought something was wrong with the game and it almost worsened my opinion of it.\n\nI love a difficult game. I can spend 16-20 hours a day playing a game I really enjoy. I could only bare to sit through 2 hours of this one at a time before getting exhausted. I never really get frustrated or angry with games, don't really get why anyone would. I didn't with Anton Blast either, mind you, i just got kinda... sad. Like I felt bad that i wasn't having fun. I figure i was doing something wrong, but it didn't feel fun figuring out what like it normally would, and as i got past stuff, I never even felt like I did figure it out. I will rarely ever give something a negative rating, and usually if i bother to it's because I cared enough about the game and really wanted to enjoy it. I feel like it should be a game I enjoy, and I just don't. I don't really know what can or if anything has to be done to even change the game to fix that, I feel like it'd be a lot. Maybe I'm just an odd outlier, but I hope I can come back to this and really enjoy it someday. I'll try and 100% it at some point if I have the time, but in it's current state I don't know if I will. :("

I was going to stream this to my friends, but I may have made them very annoyed with how I kept talking about it days before its release. I still ANTON-TASTICALLY enjoyed this game, though. Every second, every minute, every step of this game has made me very happy. I'm crying with joy because of the voice acting, music, sprites, levels, bosses, EVERYTHING. The devs did an OUTSTANDING job working on this amazing game that I will keep forever in my heart. I want to say thank you to Tony, the main director of this game. You've made me unexplainably happy ever since yesterday. You and all of the developers deserve a break after all of that. Your voice acting as Anton really made this game show lots of expression. Same goes for JB and Gianni.

        "review": "Yeah okay I'm feeling like Reviewing.\n\nAntonblast is a pretty charming game with a lot of exploration in each level. The music is very high quality for its inspiration and reminiscences of Warioland and Crash Bandicoot. The controls and gameplay are very fluid to use when you aren't forced to do a level gimmicks transportation.\n\nThe story is pretty short and sweet. Big devil man sees a guy more red than him and gets furious, sending his moles to trash the place and steal his stuff to motivate Anton to beat the living hell out of him. After that you meet a bar tender who has blacklisted you for stealing spirits, but lucky you! Those spirits are exactly what was stolen from you, so you make a deal to get them back and you get to drink. Simple. The rest is all gameplay until you get to the end which I won't say.\n\nThe collectibles are where its at for me. A lot of the items you find are sort of the same thing though, Spraycans for color swaps or Tapes for listening to secrets, etc. But the way you obtain these in certain levels leaves you feeling pretty satisfied and that's what I like about these collectibles, you have no idea where they can be and you have no idea what it could be, a spraycan could turn you into a ghost or a cassette tape plays literal rain drop effects, it's just a bunch of utter nonsense in the good way!\n\nThe level designs for the first half of the game are perfection and I have no complaints, though the other half just left me more annoyed than anything, Level 8 has you on a constant timer which you have no choice but to restart the level if you want to get everything, or level 9 with a rocket that has you going all over the place and you will definitely lose points the first time you play this level.\n\nThe bosses aren't anything to cry home about, the only necessarily good ones are the \"BIG\" bads You'd see after the first mole and third mole. The fourth mole boss is cool in concept but it might be my least favorite boss I have fought against in a long time. You essentially run around dodging normal enemies and curse words the entire battle and you have to make sure the dramameter doesn't fall to the tragedy side. If it falls to tragedy, you make no progress and the fight continues on until you eventually get to the actual \"Fight\" where you play a game of Volleyball with an over sized tomato. Yeah. Sounds all cool on paper but the actual fights the last five seconds.\n\nI also found the first half of the levels to be extremely well done. But the other half were hit or miss for me. My least favorite level has to be the mall level as I mentioned before as level 8. No offense but I don't appreciate a level where the entirety of it is put on a timer and if you are too slow or want to explore it all at your leisure, then chances are you won't be getting the spirit at the end. The enemies in this level were also just made to slow you down and not even hurt you. The cameras, the green blobs, the jumping trash goblins, everything, I had to replay this level four times just because I couldn't find everything in time and that pissed me off.\n\nThe last complaint I have is the level transport gimmicks, stuff like the Pinball ball, Bomb body and Jetpack. While I do appreciate some of these, a lot of them are very hard to control and if you have bad timing and handling, you could die very easily and be forced to retry again from the last checkpoint or during \"ITS HAPPY HOUR!.\"\n\nSpeaking of, \"IT'S HAPPY HOUR\" is a lot of fun. I love how so many levels just devolve into utter chaos in the background and foreground as you are racing by in an attempt to escape while slamming enemies out of the way with your giant mallet. It feels like being a pyromaniac and using a NUCLEAR flamethrower BABY! No issue with the timer either, its VERY generous for someone who isn't fond with Wario-Likes, like myself.\n\nOverall that covers basically everything I feel like sharing with my experience on this game. The game is REALLY good, creative, filled to the brim with chaos and insanity, fun visual and audio effects and a plethora of BLASTING gameplay. I honestly just wish there were more levels to play though."

        "review": "(THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. PLAY THE \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 GAME NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY.)\n\nAs of writing this review, I have a little over 6 hours in. I already beat the game but did not go for any collectibles. It was a TAD short, but holy mother of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 were those 6 hours a BLAST!!!\n\nThis is, beyond the SHADOW of a doubt, the BEST game I've ever played. And I've played Spider-Man 2018, Undertale, Omori, Pizza Tower, Wario Land 4, Shovel Knight, Minecraft, Terraria and other titans of gaming. This takes the cake and eats it in front of them all with a smile.\n\nFirst thing to note is the art style. What could I even say? It is breathtakingly stanky and zesty! It captures 2000's punk graphiti flawlessly and it fits the game's vibes like a glove\n\nThe music made me realize our ears each have a g-spot and this game knows how to pound it to dust EVERY time you boot up a new level. It draws obvious inspo from Wario Land (Sometimes with literal instruments and sound samples), Crash Bandicoot, Donkey Kong Country and even a bit of Sonic. EVERY level's theme is grand!\n\nThe level design is... Okay, I'll admit, it has a few kinks to work out. Most levels are great, but some are either lacking in visual theme (Some levels just feel like arrays of a color of various shades. Looking at you, factory and Concrete Jungle) or it doesn't properly convey what you need to do or go. Some level's gimmicks are better than others\n\nThe characters are ALL lovable and great!! Even the antagonist, Satan, is a lovable \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, dare I say the BEST character\n\nThe game's humor had me rolling, and I can watch South Park and Family Guy with a straight face\n\nThe transformations are all SO fun to use!! They fit each respective level perfectly and don't feel annoying or out of place, and they last the perfect amount of time\n\nThe hub world is a tiny bit easy to get lost but it's really fun, cozy and great to explore! There's probably stuff I missed\n\nThe bosses are hit or miss. Mostly with how some don't give you proper info on how to deal with them. Some bosses just need you to keep hitting them, others require you to remember patterns. Does the game ever tell you which are which? Almost never\n\nNow, onto the final boss. Spoilers ahead"

        "review": "I started following this crew right after they released Antonball Deluxe, and was there to see and back the Kickstarter for ANTONBLAST. Two years after the campaign, and with the game out in the wild now... \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.\n\nGranted, there are a few launch day kinks that could use some tending to, especially with a couple of bosses, but other than that, this is an immaculate game and what I believe is the result of Summitsphere being able to just go crazy and do whatever they wanted. The game OOZES charm and creativity and wraps it into the deceptively simple movement of Anton and Annie, which made me end up at the last level of the game in only my first play session. Without spoilers, there are also levels and other various sections of the game that, being at least semi-proficient in GameMaker (the engine this game is made in), made me lose my damn mind and visualize how they were able to pull them off on a technical level.\n\nSummitsphere have a long and prosperous future ahead of them, and you can be certain I'll be first in line for what comes next. Congratulations, guys; you deserve it."

        "review": "If you like Pizza Tower and the dead whale corpse that is the Wario Land franchise, this game is a must. Anton Blast places an emphasis on destruction and sort of going on a power trip - brilliant stress relief, I must say. The presentation is impeccable: Incredible art style with astonishing attention to detail the whole way through, everything has a very carefully-considered purpose in it. Even the skins have references in them, some of which are super obscure! The sound design is hilarious, especially if you watched Cartoon Network or Looney Tunes as a kid. And oh, lord, the music! The music blows every other game like it out of the water, I cannot sing enough praises about it. Actually getting into a level, the platforming is a good challenge; I'd compare it to Rayman 1. You'll definitely feel tested in many areas, and, true to how the game is designed, there's boundless secrets all over the place. There are plenty of reasons to replay those levels, there's a lot you can get out of them. The developers have oodles of passion and a brilliant sense of humour, and it shows in spades.\n\nBut that Rayman 1 comparison is sort of where some issues come from. The controls are a little wonky; the stages are designed with precision in mind, but sometimes you don't fully feel in control. I can't count the number of times - in my 9 hours of gameplay, mind you - where I'd barely miss a jump, succeed after a few tries, and not really know what I did wrong before. There's a little bit of screen crunch (especially in the ball segments) that makes it hard to make precise judgements as well, so you get that Rayman 1 leap of faith thing in it. I also find that the boost mechanic being mapped to the same button as the hammer flip by default is a big mistake when the platforming is so clearly centred around the latter, as you'll have times where you input the hammer flip a bit late but get a boost instead: If you know how different these movement options are, you'll know why that's a big issue! Outside of this, I think some levels (particularly the one with the monkeys) are still a bit undercooked in that they're a bit buggy. I had severe issues with the wall clinging stages in particular, where I'd sometimes start crawling the wrong way, and sometimes I would get stuck in level geometry; I believe these are both due to going too fast.\n\nFinally, I think the transformations are a very, very mixed bag. They seem to have taken a backseat compared to the other games, and I think that is for the best with how many are designed. The sole transformation I think I fully enjoyed was the robot one, and that was because it was finally something easy to control. It got to the point that I was sort of dreading these by the end of it, because I vastly preferred the hammer-flipping and boosting gameplay otherwise offered. The pinball transformation was a little too much like Sonic Spinball in the worst ways; the torpedo and jetpack are extremely unforgiving for their jerky controls; so on, so forth. Besides that, I think too many of them were \"you are now forced to go in this direction\" for the amount of stages, I would have liked more inspiration from the other \"Wario-likes\" on this account.\n\nOverall, a very fine addition to the recent \"platformer where you're just a really intense Mario who swears like a sailor\" shindig, but I want to see more...from the game, and the shindig. Further proof that the platformer genre has a lot of growing to do."

The game play is so addicting and it's really rewarding figuring out the fastest way through the stages.\nStages are all pretty unique and the boss fights are really creative and fun. Some are pretty challenging as well. If you enjoyed games like Wario Land 4 and Pizza Tower, you'll love this one. At $20 it's an instant buy."

        "review": "For disclosure, I did volunteer playtest this game before its release.\n\nThis game has come a long way since the Kickstarter demos. The spectacle, the music, the variety in stages, and, most of all, the detail in the animations is all an unstoppable force. The game definitely gets stronger as it goes on, too, so if you think it's \"pretty good\" at the beginning, you're in for a treat as it ramps up. The bosses, particularly the full-size bosses, are a ton of fun and satisfying to beat. It also made me laugh out loud more than a few times.\nThis game is definitely hard. However, it very rarely feels hard due to slippery controls or intentional obfuscation of information. Once you figure out what it wants from you, it's very fun to master. The last main level is a gauntlet that may take many tries, which I honestly think is a good thing.\nI think it will truly flourish as more patches roll in to smooth out the last of the bugs and add in the extra content, which they have already been pretty responsive about. I think the one warning I would make is that Photosensitivity Mode is not yet fully implemented, and some bosses, particularly later ones, can contain a good amount of flashing. I am not usually a 2D platformer person, but I'm going to be thinking about this one for years."

The game also has plenty of collectibles to get, providing an extra optional challenge for anyone with nothing to do after beating the game. The game also has 2 playable characters, Anton and Annie, each with their own small storyline. Each level is full of things to do, and it all flows well. If you have the money, I'd advise picking it up."

Don't buy cosmetics, instead save up for when the permanent health upgrades show up in the shop, trust me you'll need them. I'd compare Antonblast to Pizza Tower moreso than Warioland 4, despite it being inspired by the latter it shares a lot more with the former, being focused on speed and reaching the end as fast as possible rather than the puzzle focused gameplay of WL4.\n\nThe art is amazing and I really like the voice acting, there is genuine love put into this game, but I have to reiterate how brutal this game is, be prepared for frustration unless you're a platforming god. I was stuck on the final level for longer than I'd care to admit. If difficulty isn't a dealbreaker, then you'll definitely enjoy the game."

I can say, I really do enjoy this game.\nIt is more difficult than Warioland 4 or at least the stages are. I could say that the bosses might be a bit easier despite having pretty similar healthbars. In the first boss at least at the second phase, you get a checkpoint when in Warioland 4, if you screw up then you gotta start all over. Again however, in this game you have only three hearts. In Warioland 4 you have 8."

Even with accessibility options, the visual clutter can be overwhelming at times, with excessive shaking and flashing effects - an option to lower the brightness of the background to make the player and enemies stand out would be appreciated, in my opinion.\n\nSome tiny bugs here and there can occur, I've experienced mild stuttering to broken full-screen with the game only taking a quarter of my screen, fixed by a reboot, alongside some weird game interactions with gimmicks, but nothing game-breaking.\n\nWhat could be a fun and dynamic platformer can occasionally feel headache-inducing.\nThe transition from fast-paced gameplay to precise platforming can be a bit off-putting at times. With the clear Crash Bandicoot inspiration, an all-around \"easy\" mode would be a welcome addition, avoiding the need to buy items to make certain levels easier.\n\nDon't underestimate the difficulty of the game. I came out of most levels feeling frustrated by the difficulty of certain parts, rather than being in awe of the great cinematics and events.\n\nThat said, the game shines with its varied levels, rich themes, and a colorful cast of characters.\nIf you're up for a challenge and can push past the chaos, there\u2019s a lot to enjoy here."

And not in vain!\n\nI'll never forget this style, gameplay, plot, all those feelings I've experienced while playing and everything else! Antonblast is a perfect game with perfect characters. Anton, who is the main character. Annie, who's just killing for FUN. Satan, who's the sexiest being ever. Brulo, who's... uhh...-\nI LOVE how old characters from Antonball Deluxe like Danton or Nina have such a little, but inalienable role in this game.\n\nAnd oh my God THOSE EFFECTS AND EPIC BOSSFIGHTS! Those fights are more epic than any anime-fight! If you wanna see them, buy this game and beat the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of bosses YOURSELF!!\nAnd do I even need to mention all easter eggs Antonblast has? No, I don't, because you can find them by yourself (again).\n\nAntonblast took first place as my favorite game of my life. This game will never leave my heart, NEVER! I will play this game again and again, just for the fun (and achievements, of course).\n\nThank you, Summitsphere. You've changed my life to better."

So far its great even when it gets a little hard to play, so take breaks when you need to because the explosive action of this game WILL tire you out and it can get a little hard to deal with the backtracking when your hit too much.\n\nStill would recommend to any fans of platformers like it"

        "review": "AntonBlast is one of the best games I've ever played.\nThe game has a constant chaotic nature to it that just makes you want to destroy everything on your path, but also rewards you for taking your time and exploring the levels for collectables. It's pretty challenging and has a lot of Trial and Error moments SPECIALLY if you've never played the demos, but once you pull it off it's incredibly satisfying.\nThis game is also surprisingly beefy. Don't get me wrong it's not like some 20+ hours game that'll keep you entertained for the rest of your life, but, for 20 bucks, the game has more than enough to keep you coming back every now and then.\nThe graphics are beautifully animated and give off strong vibes of early 2000's cartoons that would constantly make you ask yourself \"How did they get away with this ?\", all topped off with an incredibly funky soundtrack that made me stop playing multiple times just so I could listen to it.\nThe story is very silly in my opinion, but it really just completes my previous point. The character designs, personalities and their interactions all come along to really make it feel like you're just watching an episode.\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game for anyone who's interested in chaotic experiences, weird cartoons or just platformers in general. It really is a once in a lifetime experience that I wish I could play for the first time again."

The fact that there is no game over screen also makes it much less frustrating once you keep dying to the same thing, you just spring back to action and go agane.\n\nGreat job from the devs, i hope more people give this game the chance it deserves."

        "review": "Game Of The \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Year. Backed this one over 2 years ago knowing fully well Summitsphere was capable of pulling it off after Antonball Deluxe and they still blew any expectations I had out of the stratosphere. This is gonna be a Platinum standard for the 2D platformer genre now.\n\nLike Pizza Tower before it, Antonblast is an extremely laborious project of burning passion for gaming and animation, so thoroughly synthesizing aspects of the inspirations it has while adding Summitsphere's special flavor to stand firmly on its own 2 feet, both mechanically and aesthetically. It's unique take on the Wario Land 4 level format is propped up by extremely buttery smooth controls and incredibly responsive animation, along with the level design feeding you through such an adrenaline pumping rampage in deeply cathartic and SUPER explosive destruction. And on that note, the art and sound direction mesh together to form such a rock solid and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 KICKASS identity. This is easily some of the greatest sprite vfx work ive ever seen in a game. I've had ideas about some of the stuff they pulled off visually here and it's \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 GLORIOUS!!!!!!And the soundtrack. Tony Grayson is on the upper echelon of VGM composers for me now, holy \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 dude. Such an incredible use of digital fusion music that just gets you PUMPED. THATS THE KINDA \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 I LIKE TO SEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (level 4's and 12's music especially bring me to joyful tears)\n\nAll and all, Antonblast sits right next to Pizza Tower not only as part of a new guard of the spirit of the Wario Land games that inspired them, but as an outstanding pioneer showing where indie games and the 2D platformer genre are capable of going in the modern age of digital art and game dev technology. I still have a LOT to do for 100% cleanup, and I haven't been able to do deep dives in the new modes yet, but I can abso\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665inglutely say that this game is worth your time and money. So damn excited to see whatever Summitsphere does next. BUY ANTONBLAST WITH MONEY\u2122\ufe0f!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!"

        "review": "Peak in every conceivable way.\n\nAs many others, I was introduced to Anton through the ever-popular Pizza Tower game (Don't worry, I'm not here to compare the two like a loser!). I enthusiastically followed development and bought it the exact minute it released.\n\nIt throws you into the game and immediately you can tell this game has a sweet style. There's so much charm in the intro and stage beginning, it really hooks you in. The mechanics are easy to learn but hard to master, which I feel is fantastic for keeping the game beginner-friendly.\nGame simple: Break stuff, watch number go up, jump platforms, kill people with hammers and whatnot, mad dash for exit under a timer. As the game progresses so many new mechanics, styles, enemies, gimmicks, and more just burst from the seams and it constantly keeps you invested!\nThere's such an unruly amount of satisfaction that comes from destroying everything and plowing your way through the level, clutch by clutch. That satisfaction you feel when you overcome an obstacle that was previously holding you down is something to behold!\n\nThe bosses, similarly, are fantastic. They all have fantastic movesets that balance difficulty and patterns. Admittedly, they can get a bit tight at times and it can get overwhelming to understand what's happening, but you get used to it as the game goes by. Trial and error, my friend!\nEach boss has outstanding movesets and sweet cutscenes, sometimes separate phases can completely change the way you play! They're so dang engaging.\n\nNow this game... gets difficult. Nothing too insane, but do keep in mind there will undoubtedly be multiple attempts in the later levels/bosses. That final boss especially, whew, they're a tricky one.\nBut what I love is how well this game seamlessly dips you farther and farther into the pool until you have to swim on your own. You're unconsciously learning to master your movement as it goes on, until it puts you to the test in the finale.\n\nNot even mentioning the different gamemodes to try, collectibles to find, costumes, witty and not-so-witty-yet-embarrassingly-funny humor, this is for sure one of my favorite games of the year 2024.\n\nIf you love yourself some chaos, explosions, platforms, and cartoons, this game should be right down your alley!"

        "review": "in hindsight, yea this is a good game. but holy hell, does it have some BIG flaws. the NUMBER 1 big problem with this game is that they BARLEY give you any source of help on telling you what to do. i get that they have *small* visual cues, but this game already has so much going on the screen, its difficult to tell where anton is sometimes. and none of this becomes more apparent than the Mole bosses, they dont tell you a damn thing about how to fight them, you really are kinda left out to dry, which i understand that the game wants to be challenging, but even then dude its like sometimes im literally left with ZERO \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 clue on what im supposed to do in some of these bosses, like a the prime example is the maul mole boss fight, hes the one on the stage, and he has this weird audience meter that your supposed to keep up, but trying to figure out how to keep it up is a mystery that took me like 20 trys, this issue is apparent in just about every fight (except the dragon and maybe jewel ghoul) the moles are gonna be the most annoying fights in this game.\n\nand dont even get me started on that \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 final boss, bro has like 5 phases and all of them are \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. mostly the last 2, you basically go super sonic at the end but the game dosent tell you a DAMN thing about how to use your abilities. took me like 50 trys just to realize i could fly up, satan is also a poor example of the game just having so much \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 hurled onto the screen, which for the FINAL boss, is something you want to avoid. will say tho, if i knew exactly what i was doing from the start, and if this game had a good resolution, then that final boss would be cool as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. but its not.\n\neven in some of the levels you are just completely lost, like in the pinball level i honestly just held left bc i didnt know wtf to do in the ball form and it basically just threw me to the end, but the gimmick with the actual pinball arenas is still a clue to me. another level that just confused the hell out of me was the mall one, theres like 4 puzzle rooms that you have to do challenges in and theyre fine, except the blue room which isnt even confusing, its just \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. the goblins go WAY to fast and its really annoying, ik i just got \"skill issue\" but pick this game up for yourself and youll see that this game sometimes just dosent give a rats ass about you in at least hinting on where you should go or handle the bosses. i know i could look up a tutorial but come on dude that is lame asf, and it ruins the moment.\n\nDespite the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 i just hurled at it, i still think you should play it, the levels that DONT have this problem are super \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 good, and jewel ghoul is just badass, art and music kick ass, but that should go without saying. also satan is funny too. (too bad his fight is dog cheeks)\n\nif your even remotely interested in checking it out, id say go for it. just excpect to have a hard time with the bosses."

I would say average playtime if you're just playing the main levels and not going out of your way to get the collectables is about 6-8 hours depending on your skill level. Probably 15+ getting collectables and a chunk of achievements, and god knows how long the Time Trials will take you.\n\nThis game is difficult. The devs clearly have their inspiration on their sleeve alongside the difficulty with said inspirations. It's wonderful to see but don't expect an easy rhomp."

        "review": "For a game that was backed in 72 hours, Antonblast truly delivered something special.\nIts an incredible title that is an absolute must-play treat for anyone into platformers, especially Crash Bandicoot and Wario with how massive of a love-letter it is to the two franchises. Coupled with some of the best game music I've heard in the last several years of game releases, its no wonder this game took longer than expected to release; the team's passion is really evident.\nThe gameplay is paced quite well, though, everyone giving it a try should realize its explicitly not always a speed game. Nearly each level has a unique gimmick to it that helps really break up how you can explore, and the amount of secrets really add to the replayability of each stage.\nThe game's animation style really shines thanks to its humor being a solid mix of both hilarious old inside jokes and late-night cartoon gags. Voicework and dialogue really add to this a ton, especially with Satan's absolutely delightful performance by Gianni.\nThe music in particular is what helps make this game even more insanely special; Not only is each track incredibly unique, but the team's smart use of a dynamic soundtrack that changes thru the levels just adds so much pizzazz to it. The musical references are over-the-top radical too, with so many nostalgic samples from its inspired games to new takes on musical styles (one part of a level even has a chunk of acapella to reference Crash Twinsanity). Tony really pulled it off with flying colors.\n\nThe only nitpicks (that will without a doubt be ironed out) is the balancing in the later parts of the game is a bit difficult but not impossible. A teeny tiny handful of bosses need better tells on attacks and I-frames, namely the final boss. There's a small handful of parts that lack SFX that would definitely assist the player a bit and up the experience. Only noticed a tiny number of bugs that have already been brought up and will obviously be gone within a few months time.\n\nAll in all, seeing this project grow up in the time that it took has been really invigorating as a still-learning game dev and a real paragon of how indie dev with a close knit group of buddies can truly pay off. Hats off to the team for really nailing it!"

It's a wario-like, if you haven't heard that term, just think of pizza tower. It's not as speed-oriented as PT, but it makes up for that with tighter movement, the same sort of fun gameplay, and tons of explosions. I was absolutely craving this after pizza tower."

And now that I've played through the game, I can easily say that I'm very glad I chose to back this.\nPun entirely intended, this game is an absolute blast.\n\nIt's filled to the brim with both charm and surreal-ness in its visuals and set pieces, it's got incredibly fun and challenging gameplay that continuously finds ways to keep each level and boss fight feeling fresh from the last, and it's got a superb soundtrack all throughout, just to name a handful of its strengths. And as a longtime Crash Bandicoot fan, the many ways this game homages the series (without ever feeling like it's reliant on Crash's legacy to carry it) continuously put a smile on my face.\n\nEven with a couple shortcomings here and there, this is 100% a must-play for any platformer fan, and it's easily my personal game of the year."

I played some of the earlier demos, looked at updates on their YT channel, and even submitted an art piece for the in game graffiti competition (if it made it into the game I have yet to see it). I will say, this game turned out very good. The artstyle is amazing, the music is good, the voice acting and dialogue are hilarious, the levels, while feeling a bit empty at times, have a lot of fun ideas that don\u2019t overstay their welcome.\n\nI personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s as good as Pizza Tower, but it\u2019s still a worthy competitor and a welcome edition to the now rising \u201cWario-like\u201d genre."

It really does sell how it feels to be a destructive, rampaging unstoppable force like Anton.\n\nIt's loud, exaggerated but edgy cartoon aesthetic would feel right at home with animated shows that aired on MTV in the '90s, like Beavis and Butt-Head or The Maxx. This game has a ton of really cool and unique settings for a platformer that you really just need to see for yourself to get the most out of them. I also LOVED how dynamic and cinematic all the bosses were.\n\nDespite the fast pace the game also doesn't sacrifice exploration at all, with levels tending to be very expansive with plenty of hidden away optional areas, usually having interesting side content within them.\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of stylized, fast-paced action games this is such an easy recommend."

There's even a bit a more precise platforming for secrets, which is often rewarding. I would say some parts are a bit hard to understand on the first go around, such as what each button does during a transformation or how a boss is supposed to be defeated. Once everything clicks, though, it's a ton of fun."

It also controls super nicely on top of running well so far on my portable potato. Also you tend to do a wee bit of trolling by kinda destroying levels on your way out. Oops. Also there's a dedicated scream button for the player.\n\nAt a glance, this game has a ton of palette skins to unlock and has Time Attack/Combo modes for finished levels on top of just having a really nice early difficulty curve, which honestly just makes it feel really well-polished. Speedrunners, secret hunters and explorers would all probably gonna have a great time with this one!"

        "review": "I played the demo before I got the game, and let me say this game makes pizza tower look tame! I can see tons of crash bandicoot references or nods, and as a huge platformer fan and love of Crash Bandicoot games in general, it scratches that itch while you're going 200 miles per hour! Honestly there's so much in this game, each level is chaos. The characters are fun, the reference to the devil from cow and chicken is a fun touch.\n\nAlso, the biggest thing I want to point out is I love the sound effects! It sounds SUPER arcadey and it's done so well; the first time I jumped and my hammer hit the ground and I started spinning in the air hearing it spin around blazing through the level sounded SO COOL! I felt like I could walk through an arcade and it's sound effects would fit right in next to the other games there. Also it's got a yell button, great feature.\n\nThe precision platforming isn't always necessary from what I've seen, only if you want to get all those hidden goodies. Usually you don't have to do super precise jumps going stupid fast which I appreciate.\n\nSo if you liked pizza tower and wanted something even crazier, this definitely fits the bill. Long story short, I'm having a BLAST!"

Every asset in the game just oozes style and flair.\nplease play this game! I would compare it to Wario Land or Crash Bandicoot or some such thing, but frankly that wouldn't do it justice. I'm only a few levels in so far, but I think it's easily my favorite game to come out in recent years!"

        "review": "- EDIT: Revising my review -\n\nI really liked Pizza Tower, it became my sole focus for maybe a year, I'm still modding it occasionally.\n\nAnton Blast though, it tickled something lost to me for years. Something Pizza Tower didn't, it tickled the part of my brain that Wario Land 4 did when I played it on the GBA, and arguably went beyond.\n\nFirst, the visuals. They scream 2000s in so many ways and emulate the best parts of art that I would say the GBA featured. 3D, claymation, all kinds of fantastical visuals that capture your eyes. They game can sometimes be such a visual spectacle that I get \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 overloaded, thankfully not to the point that it hindered gameplay. It looks so good, I cannot explain it.\n\nThe movement is in my opinion, a tough shell to crack, but very much in the sonic sense, where it really takes time and practice. Thankfully, the game is built so that even if you can't play like a pro, you can still beat it.\n\nDIFFICULTY, damn \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665!!! It's not cuphead but its getting close, it kicked my ass at the end, but not in a way where I got too frustrated or tired of playing. I'm personally \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 at games, I can't beat DS3, but I managed to beat this game in about 6 hours while I was going nonstop (and ignoring the ridiculous amount of collectibles)\nThat being said, it was a welcome difficulty, one that I gotta be real, Pizza Tower doesn't have. It's challenge comes from P ranks, which is fantastic, but I never felt opposed on my first playthrough. Hell Manor felt like a real fight, \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.\n\nMUSIC, its a bop, simple as, the only crime is it's not on youtube yet and I'm not sure it all the songs have been posted anywhere.\n\nMy only gripe is it can't be modded. If the devs are reading reviews, please allow modding through UTMT, I'm desperate to mod this game like I did with PT. I wanna make levels and character skins PLEASE"

JEWEL GHOUL MIGHT BE MY FAVORITE BOSS IN 2D GAMES EVER.\n\nThis soundtrack will be on my playlist FOR SURE. Like wow, some of these tracks didn't have any right to be as good as they are, man. The voices for the characters are, and always have been perfect.\n\n\n\nI do have some major complaints though.\n\n1. The latter half of the game has some stages in them that become infuriating to the point where things start to make less sense. I'm looking at you, Pinball stage and Level 12.\n2. The overall difficulty curve was unwarranted. Seriously. And I get that Crash was its main inspiration, but the two mentioned stages were genuinely just bad in my opinion.\n3. The first phase of Satan's fight is sooo baffingly jarring. It's SO frustrating to where all I could think of were how badly I wanted this character dead. SPOILER TERRITORY: but that first phase needs fixes, BADLY. It reeeaally hurt to see the\n\n\n\nAnd finally, the general feeling I have for this game is...\nIt's complicated. The first half of the game was groundbreaking, a juggernaut, while a fat majority of the latter half just either genuinely blew to go through or just felt... less fun. I can't say I don't love this game, though.\n\nI'm a hater of giving games scores, but I'll do one right now to appease those who do care;\n7/10"

        "review": "What is there to really say that hasn't already been said years before? The game is a masterpiece!\nThe controls at first do seem a little demanding, and at times might feel weird, but once you get used to it after the first few levels, you become a real pro! The visuals are amazing, and there was no point in the game where the art was bad.\nLevel Design wise, was also amazing. Sometimes continuity felt strange, but it never hurt the game-play experience, sometimes actually helping it. For those who are interested in the game, just know that this game DOES get demanding in the latter half. Especially near the end, this game is not for the weak. Other specific things to note is that the game is very replay-able, and encourages it with collectibles, cosmetics to unlock, and more!\n\nOverall: This game is an amazing 6-hour experience, but it's definitely worth every penny, pound, and euro of your purchase! The game's humor is also well done. I am satisfied with the final product.\n\nFor one final thing, I did encounter a few bugs, but I'm sure those will get patched out, if not already.\n\nIf you've got 20 buckaroonies to spare, BUY THE GAME! PLEASE!"

        "review": "Only halfway through the game's story at the time of writing this but this game might genuinely be my favourite game I played this year. The levels are all unique with different vibes and phenomenal music accompanying them. The bosses so far are also really well designed, they're difficult if you don't know what you're doing, but also challenging should it finally click what you gotta do. I backed the game in mid 2022 and I've been watching how the game evolved throughout the two and a half years and even with what's been revealed and shown by the devs and PR team already, I still find new things to cherish, appreciate, have a little giggle or even laugh uncontrollably about. ANTONBLAST is genuinely a work of love and passion. I'm happy to have supported the game's development financially back then and I'm happy to support the game even further by purchasing the soundtrack when it ever becomes available.\n\nIf you haven't checked the game out and are looking for a snappy, action-packed platformer with Wario Land 4 and Crash Bandicoot influences, do not miss out on this game. If not on sale, this game is easily the worth the 20 US dollars and it's guaranteed you'll have a ton of fun, if not a BLAST. Just make sure to not go fast immediately. Instead take it slow and learn the stages until you're comfortable rushing through them."

It is filled with so much charm, style and attitude that you can't help but be drawn in by all the chaos. The story is simple because it doesn't need to be anything else, and it's damn funny too. The gameplay is easily the best part, every move flows into each other beautifully and makes traversing the 12 sprawling levels a joy. The music is absolutely stellar. The game's director and composer, Tony Grayson, knocked it out of the park. Everyone at Summitsphere knocked it out of the park, you can feel everyone's influence on the game's direction throughout the game.\n\nHats off to you, Summitsphere. You've made a stellar game. Now drink up, my friends! It's happy hour!"

First Look at Fast Paced Action platformer like Pizza Tower! [NO COMMENTARY] \nViews: 33\nANTONBLAST is a fast-paced explosive action platformer that's all about destruction.

        "review": "While I do highly recommend this game, the music,art and gameplay being as fantastic as they are,\nPLEASE BE AWARE BEFORE BUYING:\n\nThe game gets very mechanically demanding very quickly, and there's noticeable difficulty spikes during happy hour segments that demand you chain mechanics you just learned together in a very satisfying, yet fast paced and demanding way. This is very notable in level 6 especially.\n\nThe levels are also very vertical at times, unless you have absolute mastery of the movement, do not expect to be going super fast all the time\n\nI know a lot of pizza tower fans will be playing this, just know it's a completely different ebb and flow and to not expect it to be pizza tower two with scores and movement and stuff. this game is it's own thing and has been in development just as long!!\n\nDO NOT GO INTO THIS GAME EXPECTING IT TO BE AN EASY,CASUAL PLATFORMER!\nGo into it expecting to be challenged :)\n\nAlso the music, gameplay, and art are ON POINT! It may be pretty tough to get a hang of the movement, but when you start feeling that flow, it FLOWS SO SMOOTHLY!"

The sheer amount of dopamine that I had experienced playing through this game can only be rivaled by that of my first kiss. And even then, that intimate moment has been blasted to high hell. It's not Pizza Tower 2, because it doesn't need to be. Between the excellent, engaging movement, wonderful art style and SENSATIONAL soundtrack, I couldn't recommend this enough. If you're in the market for another Wario Land styled game, look no further, Anton does what Pizza To-Won't. (But play Pizza Tower too.)"

The first level was decent as it was in the demo, the second one was okay but the controls of whatever that torpedo were just annoying as hell and that first boss essentially sealed the deal for me that this is not the game for me. Controls feel clunky especially when the game slows down everything and just says \"No more running you are doing careful platforming now\".\n\nI was really excited for this game and the music and art is absolute banger but the gameplay and leveldesign choices even this early on were just simply not fun. They didn't felt like a challange they just felt like they broke the pasting for the sake of it.\n\nI really don't like compairing games and I did not go into this expecting Pizza Tower 2, but playing Pizza Tower indirectly just made this game feel clunky in compairsion and I am not talking about just going fast I am talking about not being able to get out of a jump, groundpounds getting stuck on the smallest edge, running through anything thats not a straight line feeling bad thanks to the very close-up camera not allowing you to see whats ahead its just a lot of smaller things that muddy the experience."

It's hard to express exactly why it is so good because every single aspect of it is some of the most impressive the genre has ever seen.\nIts strongest characteristic is the fact that it is very willing to completely throw away gimmicks and ideas level to level and introduce new mechanics in a way that is very confident in itself. That confidence is earned, as every level here on display is impressive beyond belief and is never left feeling under-explored mechanically. It has no levels that are of lesser quality than each other, which is a miracle, considering how easy it is to have just a single level that's just slightly worse than the rest. But it never happens.\nIt's clear to me this is a game made by people who love video games and I cannot recommend it enough if you love video games too."

It's got very satisfying movement and fun fast-paced gameplay. However, don't go into this game expecting the same experience as pizza tower. Pizza tower and antonblast may have some similar traits, but they are very different games from each other. But that's not really a bad thing. Over all, a worthy successor to the wario-land series. The developers did a great job with this one, and I'm interested in seeing future projects from them."

        "review": "I knew Anton in highschool and he would literally pay boys to let him blast all over them. One of my friends had drug addicted parents that didn't give him any lunch money and he would see Anton in Brulo's Casino multiple times a week just because his stomach would hurt so much during 1st period from blasting. I didn't know at the time, it was only after we met up in our 2nd year of college and had some drinks that he opened up about it. I assumed he was only doing so because he was tipsy but apparently he had lots of sessions with Satan to try and deal with it. The most disturbing thing about his story was that Anton was obsessed with balls, his fantasy was to blast balls all over the screen. My friend of course didn't own Antonball Deluxe so he had trouble keeping the balls on the screen for awhile, and often times Anton got so frustrated with the lack of blasting that he would deny my friend any payment and storm off, leaving him in tears. But slowly Anton got better with practice and was soon forcibly making the poor guy blast with his technique. As I'm hearing all this \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 I would have been in complete disbelief, had I not witnessed how my friend acted during and after lunch break. I always assumed he was crying because of his family problems, I always thought he was distant because Brulo always belittled him. But now I know, and I feel truly wish that were me in that scenario, and I don't feel sorry for him."

Of course, it's not without recently divorced Brulo's help.\n\nI first and foremost recommend this blast of a game the most to disgruntled Nintendo fans starving for any Wario content that isn't Ware since 2008, 'cause boy, if Pizza Tower wasn't enough dinner on the table, THIS is the dessert everybody's looking for. It's got just right amount of fluid gameplay, crazy (and) good artstyle, bangin' soundtrack (props to Tony Grayson!), and everything else. You'll find yourself replaying this game more than once, with how addictive it was designed to be, thanks to the two additional game modes, and way more. In this game, rushing through the stages like a wrecking ball just HITS that spot in the brain. There aren't enough words for me to shill this game, so please, your wallet is yearning for you to press that purchase button!"

I've been friends with the developers since the release of Antonball Deluxe. This game has shaped up and stepped up in quality constantly over it's storied development. The game's been delayed a few times. But believe me, Miyamoto's quote is right on the money. \"Antonblast is really good!\" he says. Damn right, Shiggy. Damn right.\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, I'm proud of Summitsphere. This game kicks so much ass. It is an expression of the team's tastes that sizzles on the tongue and falls down the throat as spicily as one of Anton's spirits. I love this game. I loved testing it. I loved helping on marketing materials. I loved backing it! I love Anton! I wish Satan was my husband!\n\nBut seriously, this game will kick your ass. Get ready for that. It ain't for the faint of heart. Do you like secret hunting? There are SO many secrets in this game. SO MANY. Check the hub, check all the levels. So much to find for the curious. Do you like speedrunning? You'll find there's a LOT to do on that front. Hop back into any level for new challenges. Do you like increasingly obscure references to things the development team like? Check Brulo's shop after every level. Do you like Blake? The red \"Welcome To Server\" dog from the Summitsphere discord? He's in the game. Go look.\n\nAntonblast has so much to give, and it's gonna be giving for a WHILE. What a game, what a game. Incredible."

Many of this game's strong points (of which there are a good amount) are bogged down heavily by confusing design decisions that make moment-to-moment gameplay feel awkward and infuriating. I'll try to compile my honest thoughts and critical feedback at a later date, but in a nutshell, it feels like the experience of the player is treated as an afterthought, and it results in the game as a whole kicking significantly less ass during gameplay than you would expect it too."
