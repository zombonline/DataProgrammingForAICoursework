The quirky physics, the \"play-doh\" graphics and open-ended puzzles simply make every session unpredictable. One of the things that's really has impressed me is how the developers have kept adding updates over the years, bringing new levels and showing so much love for the game 8 years after its release. It\u2019s the kind of game that keeps you laughing, experimenting, and wanting to come back for more. Definitely a great game to try out with a friend or two :)"

        "review": "Human: Fall Flat is a quirky, physics-based puzzle platformer that delivers endless fun through its charmingly awkward characters and challenging puzzles. Players control Bob, a wobbly, customizable humanoid character, as they navigate a series of open-ended levels filled with puzzles that require creativity, cooperation, and a good sense of humor. The game\u2019s mechanics revolve around manipulating objects and the environment in unique ways, often leading to hilarious and unpredictable outcomes.\n\nThe physics-driven gameplay can be both amusing and frustrating, as Bob's flailing arms and unpredictable movements create comedic moments but also add challenge to tasks. It\u2019s a game best enjoyed with friends, as the cooperative multiplayer mode amplifies the chaos and laughter.\n\nVisually, Human: Fall Flat offers a simplistic, low-poly art style that complements its light-hearted tone. Though it can feel repetitive at times, the game's charm and ability to make even simple tasks entertaining keeps players engaged. It's a great pick for casual gamers looking for a fun and occasionally absurd experience, especially when shared with others."

        "review": "A wacky, wobbly physics based game that is fun either solo or with friends! I had originally played this game about 7 years ago on Nintendo Switch and to be honest, I didn't appreciate the game very much. At least, nowhere near as much as I should have. I didn't make that mistake the second time around on Steam Deck OLED.\n\nThis game is a blast, and it is incredibly fun figuring out different ways to get through each area and solve the various puzzles that are presented throughout the campaign. If the main levels weren't enough, you also have access to \"Extra Dreams\" which are large levels that are designed around a particular theme. Every single one of them are fun to play and most of them are drastically different in comparison to each other. If that also wasn't enough, there are thousands of Steam Workshop levels and character skins to choose from that will extend your gameplay time immensely. I haven't even finished all of the Extra Dreams yet.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is hard to describe, but it exactly what I would think a game's music in a game named Human Fall Flat would be. There are a few clever songs that evoke a range of emotions though they mostly only play during the beginning of a level, or when you progress far enough to reach a key point in the level. I also enjoy the random quiet ambiance that the game has as well when music isn't playing.\n\nThe gameplay is hard to describe, but for some reason, it is so addicting. You have to use both hands which each hand is controlled with a different button, and you can use them in conjunction with the physics to get through some of the levels in very cool, satisfying ways. The gameplay in this game strangely also just makes sense. The puzzles may be confusing at times, but the gameplay itself isn't!\n\n\nOverall, if you have a desire for a wacky physics based game for yourself or a family member, you couldn't go wrong with this one. This game checks all the boxes on what I would expect a game of this type to deliver, and it does so in spades. Get wobbling, friends!"

With all levels unlocked from the start and no tangible rewards for completing them, the game struggles to incentivize continued play beyond its achievements. This design choice undermines any sense of accomplishment, leaving each level to stand solely on its individual merits.\n\nWhile many levels are undeniably entertaining, some feel redundant, offering little variation from previous stages. This repetition can dull the game's initial charm, especially during longer sessions. That said, the gameplay itself remains a joy for those seeking simple, goofy fun. The slapstick interactions and cooperative chaos are undeniably engaging, particularly when playing with friends.\n\nUltimately, Human Fall Flat delivers exactly what it promises: pure ragdoll platforming. For some, that\u2019s more than enough. But for others, it might leave them wishing for just a little more substance to match its widespread popularity."

(for free btw)\n\n\nConsidering its cheap price tag (especially on sale), it's a very easy recommendation from me."

        "review": "This game is like the best three bucks I've ever spent in my life. I can definitely pass up a McDonald's Cheeseburger with Small Fries just to purchase this game. I mean heck, even if it came with Chicken McNuggets\u00ae I'd still pass it up for this game. You'd be surprised how many games I've played that fail this test.\n\nI'm just going to keep this review simple. Every major Steam sale, the devs release a new map. If you've known me for a while, then you know I've been boycotting stuff like DLC's since 2013. YOU ARE GETTING TWO NEW FREE QUALITY MAPS EVERY YEAR!\n\nWhat you see in the trailers and screenshots of the Steam store page is what you get. But perhaps what it doesn't show is how hilariously funny this game can be when randoms join in and begin to do things like holding your friends back or trying to throw them off the cliff side. At the very beginning you kind of think, WTF? Is this just a troll trying to stop us from completing the puzzles in the game? But everyone I have encountered so far is very polite. One of the things I like doing myself is mimicking Rocky Balboa, punching randoms in the face when they enter.\n\nLevels are not really linear, but also not annoyingly multipathed if you're OCD. So you'll see some players do things like mastering how to climb walls, or taking interesting shortcuts you've never thought of before. As you progress through the main levels, new gameplay dynamics are introduced, like connecting batteries or using zip lines which keeps things interesting.\n\nThe Steam achievements also add to the fun and longevity. This is a must have game for those that want to chill and have some laughs with mates, whilst having randoms join in. The more people the merrier."

You can't navigate across the maps in unique ways with friends to find different areas of the map, they are entirely linear, limiting, and not enjoyable.\nThe puzzles are very repetitive and putting achievements 10 minutes into linear levels that then require skill on a particular segment, only for the game awkwardly make you fail through no fault of your own is not an enjoyable experience. I will likely continue to get achievement but much like paying taxes, I will not enjoy my time."

All of the levels are unlocked from the start and there's no rewards for beating any of them. There's also way too many levels in this game that don't feel like they add much compared to previous stages. The levels are fun though, if not a bit repetitive over time.\n\nYou get what it says on the box, and in this case it's pure rag-doll platforming. Nothing more, nothing less."

        "review": "Fall Flat\u2013 How a Game Became the Key to My Heart and Healed My Soul\n\nIt\u2019s strange to think that a quirky, physics-based puzzle game like *Human: Fall Flat* could be the thing that changed my life. But looking back, it feels like fate. I had always struggled with depression, an overwhelming sense of loneliness that clung to me no matter how hard I tried to fight it. But *Human: Fall Flat*\u2014of all things\u2014became a bridge that led me out of that darkness. More than just a distraction from the heaviness I carried, it became the place where I found connection, joy, and, unexpectedly, my husband.\n\nI remember the first time I stumbled upon *Human: Fall Flat*. I had been in a dark place for months, unable to shake the constant weight of sadness that seemed to follow me wherever I went. I was tired of feeling like I was walking through life in a fog, disconnected from the world around me. I\u2019d tried many things\u2014therapy, journaling, reading\u2014but nothing seemed to help. I wanted to try something new, something that might bring a spark of light into the monotonous gloom of my days. And then I found *Human: Fall Flat*.\n\nAt first glance, the game seemed like nothing special. It was colorful, charming, and had a unique sense of humor\u2014physics-based puzzles where you control a wobbly, customizable human character (or, as they\u2019re called in the game, \"humans\") that could barely stand upright. The movement was clunky, the puzzles were absurd, and everything was designed to make you laugh. I figured I\u2019d give it a go, hoping it would be a fun distraction, but I didn\u2019t expect it to become the therapy I never knew I needed.\n\nAs I started playing, I quickly realized that *Human: Fall Flat* was more than just a silly, mindless game. It was the kind of game that made you think and laugh at the same time. The puzzles were challenging, yet rewarding. The mechanics felt imperfect on purpose, creating hilarious, often chaotic moments of stumbling, falling, and eventually succeeding. The more I played, the more I found myself smiling\u2014genuinely smiling\u2014for the first time in what felt like years. There was something oddly therapeutic about the simplicity of the game, the freedom it gave me to explore, to laugh, and to forget about my problems, even if just for a few hours.\n\nBut the real turning point came when I decided to play the game online.\n\nI hadn\u2019t really considered multiplayer when I first started playing. The idea of playing with strangers, of interacting with people in the virtual world, felt intimidating to me. I was used to isolating myself, to staying in my shell where no one could hurt me. But for some reason, one night, I decided to join a public server. The idea of teaming up with other players to solve puzzles felt like it could be fun\u2014and maybe it would help me break free from the rut I had been stuck in.\n\nThat\u2019s when I met him.\n\nI remember the first time I saw his character, a wobbly human figure running around in the same silly, unpredictable way as mine. We were both stuck on the same puzzle\u2014a particularly tricky one involving a giant ball and a series of platforms that had to be moved in just the right way. We kept failing, over and over, but instead of getting frustrated, we started laughing at the absurdity of it all. There was something so comforting about sharing that failure with someone, knowing that we were both just two goofy characters trying to figure it out together.\n\nHe was kind, patient, and surprisingly good at the game. But more than that, he had an infectious energy that made everything feel lighter. Every time we failed, he\u2019d say something funny, or we\u2019d share a moment of mutual frustration that only made us laugh harder. The game, which had once been an escape from my loneliness, was now becoming a place where I felt connected to someone. I had found someone who didn\u2019t judge me for my mistakes, who wasn\u2019t trying to impress me or compete with me\u2014someone who simply enjoyed the experience as much as I did.\n\nAfter several rounds of playing together, he sent me a message. \"Hey, you're really good at this! Want to team up more often?\" I was surprised, flattered even. But there was something in the simplicity of his message that resonated with me. It was easy. It wasn\u2019t forced. It felt like we had built a bond over something as small as falling off a ledge together. And that bond grew stronger the more we played.\n\nWe spent hours each night playing *Human: Fall Flat*, figuring out puzzles, laughing, and simply enjoying each other\u2019s company. With every game, I found myself looking forward to our sessions, not because of the game itself, but because of the connection I felt with him. He was kind, funny, and made me feel like I wasn\u2019t alone in the world. Slowly, I began to realize that I was no longer just playing a game to escape my depression. I was playing to connect with him.\n\nAs weeks went by, we exchanged messages outside of the game. We talked about our lives, our interests, our struggles, and our hopes for the future. He was an incredible listener, always patient and understanding, and he shared his own battles with mental health, which made me feel seen and heard in ways I hadn\u2019t in a long time. The more we shared, the more I realized that this wasn\u2019t just a fleeting friendship\u2014it was something deeper.\n\nAnd one day, after hours of playing and talking, he asked, \"Would you ever want to meet in person?\"\n\nMy heart skipped a beat. It felt like a big step, but at the same time, it felt right. We had built something real, something meaningful, despite the distance between us. After talking about it, I agreed. We made plans, and a few months later, we met for the first time.\n\nThe moment I saw him in person, I knew. There was no awkwardness, no hesitation. It felt like we had been friends for years, like our connection had been destined all along. We spent the day together, exploring the city, laughing, and sharing stories. It was the beginning of something incredible.\n\nFrom there, things moved naturally. Our friendship deepened into something more\u2014something beautiful. We continued to play *Human: Fall Flat* together, but now it wasn\u2019t just about the game. It was about the joy we shared, the laughter that filled the air, and the way we supported each other through everything, including the tough times. My depression, which had once felt like a constant companion, started to lift. I wasn\u2019t cured, but I was healing, and a huge part of that healing was the connection I found with him.\n\nWe eventually got married, and even now, we still play *Human: Fall Flat* together. It\u2019s become our special game, the one that reminds us of where it all began. Every time we stumble and fall in the game, we remember how far we\u2019ve come\u2014not just in solving puzzles, but in life. Together, we built something stronger than any game could ever represent.\n\nLooking back, I can hardly believe how a simple game turned into the key to my happiness. *Human: Fall Flat* gave me laughter, a sense of accomplishment, and most importantly, a connection that saved me from the depths of my depression. In that virtual world, I found not just a teammate, but a partner for life\u2014someone who made me believe that I was worthy of love, joy, and happiness.\n\nSometimes, life is full of surprises, and *Human: Fall Flat* was the unexpected one that changed everything."

This physics-based puzzle platformer is good on its own but becomes amazing when you play with friends. The real charm lies in the chaos\u2014you\u2019ll spend half the time solving puzzles and the other half goofing around, throwing each other off ledges, and sabotaging the \"team effort.\"\n\nEven when you decide to get serious and actually tackle the maps, the game still delivers. Some puzzles are surprisingly tricky, requiring real teamwork (or just clever chaos). But nothing feels impossible when you\u2019ve got 5 idiots flailing around, accidentally solving puzzles in the most unexpected ways.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the Workshop! The community-made skins are absolutely hilarious\u2014dressing up as anything from superheroes to random memes adds another layer of ridiculousness to the experience.\n\nWhether you're in it for the laughs or the creative problem-solving, this game never fails to entertain. Just be prepared to spend a lot of time falling off the map... on purpose."

No annoying achievements that make you spend a certain amount of time with the game open or anything like that. Just challenges that aren't too hard to figure out. Definitely recommend!\n\nAlso, the achievements are what taught me there are, apparently, different lobbies? Christmas and Lunar? Or that you can just hang out in a lobby? Wild. Glad I learned."

What about the glitch where in split screen, one controller won't work?\nThe first time I played, I had a lot of fun. And then the 2nd time I played, one of the controllers wouldn't work. I tried everything and there was a reddit post that explains strange steps to make it work. The post was a year old and that didn't help either. I probably tried different things for an hour and I gave up. I got it to work once but then I couldn't grab anything. At that point I was too frustrated to try.\nAlthough the game is fun itself, this controller frustration made me give up and I stop having the desire to play the game. And this game is nearly a decade old!"

This is actually fun if you have friends to play with or if you dont then its still fun cause i dont have friends who play this game :( But this game is good and i love the level design especially on the newer levels, and if you get bored from basic levels and extra levels you can always just go outside (or play other peoples levels from workshop)"

        "review": "I would recommend it. I play with 3 other friends and have a blast playing it. It\u2019s fun dragging them over the edge of the map randomly lol. There is no death technically as you instantly respawn. I would say the hardest part about the game are the controls which have quite large learning curve imo. Takes some time getting used to. The maps themselves scale fairly well from easy to hard. Depending on how good you and your friends are at solving puzzles you may finish the game in 10-15 hours. I remember one level I was doing with my friends on playstation took 3 hours to complete the coast then and the second time we did it in 30min.\n\nOnly downside I would say is some levels were clearly only designed for one player so having multiple makes it too easy. For example one puzzle may involve getting a box onto a switch to open the door to the next part. In multiplayer it\u2019s as simple as just one player standing on the switch while the other goes through the door. Yes you can decide to do the levels properly. Although sometimes it\u2019s quite fun looking for ways to solve the puzzles as quickly as possible by seeing what parts we can skip entirely."

But I had had enough when I first finished it.\n\nThe thing that pushes it past frustrating is when the new maps and achievements are bugged or glitch and softlock. Three times I've had to repeat the newest level and a rope gets stuck making the level unfinishable or a cannon ball rolls into a place where another objects collision mesh makes it ungrabbable and the level unfinishable. What's more is this final achievement has no indication that it needs to be completed without dying or restarting but it has failed to trigger multiple times. I can't tell if it's bugged or had this unwritten requirement because something glitches and softlocks me forcing a restart. Beyond frustrating."

Loading last check point if you hit the laser in one of the three points you will not get the achievement, it seems you need to run trough the full map up to the lasers and then do that in one go to get it. Also the vases on the scales keep slightly vibrating which makes them fall of even if you stand them up next to each other as center as possible.\n\nAlso if you restart the map trough \"ESC\" and \"Restart level\" the two yellow batteries stay in place where you need to place them, but the bridge to the other side of the sewer won't open. You can't remove the batteries either so you need to always go trough the main menu to start the level over again."

I highly recommend this game to anyone who appreciates fun, well-crafted 3d games. There never has been, nor will there ever be a game that can match HFF as far as potential for endless possibilities and fun. However, be warned\u2014when you start playing, you will not want to stop. Strongly recommended!"

        "review": "played this on Macbook pro m3. this is a pretty fun game but the camera movement gives me motion sickness and it stops being enjoyable because of that. the camera should be more stable. if you have motion sickness this game isnt for you. i don't have this problem with like 95% of games so i found it strange feeling a little nauseous.\ni like the colors and the simple design of this game. the character outfits are cute n funny. free customization. good, detailed puzzles.\nsometimes it is hard to grab objects or grab onto something. a bit hard to get to destinations. the characters are too wobbly and its hard to seriously finish a task or just not be useless. that is really frustrating to me!!!\nthey should also add a graphics quality tab so you could change it if you want to. some people may want to lower the quality for multiple reasons.\nlastly i would like to thank the developers for making this game MacOS compatible because apple has recently started performing better with games and people on these devices also want to play something good.\nif the creators notice all of these small problems and try to better the game physics and UI then i could fully recommend this game, if not them id rather say its a 50/50 game. Not for everyone."

The physics are so wonky that if you tried to describe them to someone, they'd think you were having a stroke. Bob\u2019s limbs seem to operate independently of each other, like he\u2019s constantly trying to get an extra paycheck from the \u201cLimbs for Sale\u201d store.\n\nThe puzzles in Human: Fall Flat are a delightful mix of genius and sheer nonsense. You\u2019ll find yourself swinging from a rope like an overgrown monkey, trying to use a seesaw as a catapult, or balancing on a giant log with the grace of a baby giraffe on roller skates. The game\u2019s design encourages creative solutions, which mostly translates to \u201clet\u2019s see how many ways I can break this without actually solving the puzzle.\u201d\n\nHonestly, it is the perfect game for anyone who enjoys laughing at their own incompetence or watching friends bumble around like they\u2019re trying to solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube while blindfolded. If you ever need a reminder of how ridiculously entertaining failure can be, this game is your hilarious, wobbling, flailing answer."

The need to click and hold for extended periods of times and repeatedly is not for the faint of heart, or more to the point those with issue with their fingers and joints. Though i do admit it depends on the mouse in question as to how bad it might be.\nDoing that while also having move your mouse around and hold both left and right mouse buttons at the same time is not at all enjoyable, and only the desire to complete all the achievements and the otherwise okay game play has kept me playing and not completely annoyed that i bought the game only to suffer.\nIf there was a demo i'd said play that first before deciding if the above and the annoying physics and mechanics that don't want to cooperate and be consistent all the time are for you or not."

        "review": "The Ultimate Chaos Simulator!\n\nHuman Fall Flat is a game that perfectly captures the essence of joyful absurdity. Imagine a platformer where your character\u2019s lack of coordination is not a bug, but a feature\u2014and you\u2019ve got yourself a recipe for endless hilarity. Whether you\u2019re solo or wrangling up to 8 friends, this game is a riot of flailing limbs, comical physics, and the kind of chaos that will have you laughing until you cry.\n\nNavigating through floating dreamscapes with your wobbly, gelatinous avatar is a mix of slapstick comedy and puzzling adventure. The true magic happens when you bring friends into the mix; the sheer unpredictability of cooperative play, combined with everyone\u2019s attempts to wrestle control over their hapless characters, makes for a comedy show that\u2019s impossible to top. Expect lots of stumbling, unexpected falls, and probably a few moments where you question why you\u2019re trying to move a giant boulder with your friends.\n\nWith free new levels keeping the game fresh, Human Fall Flat never loses its charm. It\u2019s the perfect recipe for a fun-filled game night where the only rule is to embrace the chaos and have a good laugh. So grab some friends, get ready for some hilariously disastrous teamwork, and prepare to experience a platformer where the fun is only matched by the complete and utter lack of control.\n\nGenerated with AI and <3"

The game's quirky physics and cooperative multiplayer mode ensure that every playthrough is full of laughter and unpredictability. Solve puzzles, explore diverse environments, and enjoy the chaos with friends or solo. Its simple yet engaging mechanics make it easy to pick up and hard to put down. Perfect for a fun and lighthearted gaming session with a touch of creative problem-solving."

But the one thing that I just simply love about this game is all of the techniques that I have learned all throughout the years playing this game and it has just carried me forward a lot, considering that I can beat the levels faster and can basically just speedrun the entire game with no issues. I know some people get mad at me because I can't even give them the chance to try and catch up with me or they are just jealous, honestly. I can even do backflips and frontflips on solid ground just by some practice and some help from a friend names Hands99. He's the man. Go check him out in my friends list. Anyway. This is all I have to say about this amazing game that I have been playing for a very long time now. See y'all in Human Fall Flat 2 ;)"

I managed to enjoy the game despite this, but for many it could be unbearable. so do have that in mind when buying the game.\n\nother than that, great game!"

        "review": "Human: Fall Flat is a frustrating and tedious experience that fails to live up to its potential. The wonky physics and imprecise controls make even simple tasks a chore, leading to more aggravation than fun. The puzzles lack creativity and often rely on trial-and-error rather than clever solutions.\n\nThe visuals are bland and uninspired, with dull environments that all start to look the same after a while. The character customization options are limited and don't add much to the overall experience.\n\nWhile the concept of a physics-based puzzle platformer sounds promising, the execution in Human: Fall Flat is severely lacking. The co-op mode, which should be a highlight, often devolves into a mess of uncoordinated movements and accidental sabotage.\n\nThe game's attempts at humor fall flat (pun intended), with the slapstick nature of the controls wearing thin quickly. Overall, Human: Fall Flat is a disappointing game that's more likely to test your patience than provide genuine entertainment. Save your money and time for a more polished and enjoyable puzzle platformer."

        "review": "\u00abHuman Fall Flat\u00bb - is an engaging indie game. It quickly gained popularity thanks to its unique physics-based gameplay mechanics and unusual puzzles.\n\nPhysics Interaction:\nPlayers control a character who moves and interacts with the environment using unique and amusing physics. The character's movements appear comical and unpredictable, adding a unique charm to the game. Every step and action require the player to control the character's arms and legs, creating additional challenges and fun.\n\nUnusual Puzzle Solving:\nPlayers need to solve a variety of puzzles using physics and object interactions. Tasks can include moving boxes, using levers and buttons, building bridges, and much more. An important aspect of the game is the freedom to choose solutions: players can approach solving tasks in different ways, making each playthrough unique.\n\nFun in Co-op:\n\u00abHuman Fall Flat\u00bb is especially good in co-op mode. The game supports multiplayer, where several players can team up to complete levels together."

It's really fun when you learn all the tricks that are in the game and you can start running through levels like no one's business. It has pretty good workshop support (mostly from Chinese players because the game is $0.50 in the PRC) and near endless content. My only gripe is that they update the game with new achievements every few months and the new levels lately have been so, so bad with just tedious to be tedious achievements. Most people won't 100% the game though, so don't worry about that."

Adem\u00e1s hay toques de humor aqu\u00ed y all\u00e1, los desarrolladores disfrutan tom\u00e1ndonos el pelo en ocasiones, o anim\u00e1ndonos a sonreir con ellos.\n\nAdem\u00e1s de la campa\u00f1a base, cuyos niveles van subiendo poco a poco de dificultad, el juego va incorporando de manera oficial nuevos escenarios, la mayor parte de ellos mejores que los de la campa\u00f1a base. Y adem\u00e1s hay centenares de escenarios desarrollados por la comunidad, muchos de ellos tambi\u00e9n de alta calidad.\n\nVamos, que si le pillas el gusto, tienes entretenimiento para mucho rato."

The puzzles in each level aren't that difficult to figure out, so majority of one's efforts and time is spent dealing with the awkward ragdoll physics, which gets tiring fast.\n\nMaybe its better with friends, but as a solo game, there are better platforming puzzle games out there."

        "review": "Great game. Great physics. Great multiplayer. There are a lot of things great about this game like the fact that you can press a button to ragdoll and just let someone drag you around which is fun. Although you kind of need someone to play with you otherwise you are just running around solving puzzles but if you have someone to play with then great. I also like how there isn't just random voice chat on the steam version because on the Xbox version if you join multiplayer then everyone will just hear you and all of your personal info and you have to instantly mute so I like how that isn't in this version. I have the Xbox version of this game but I got the steam version because it is better because of steam workshop which is like infinite levels and cool modded stuff like sometimes you might find a fake player ragdoll in a modded map which is fun to toss around if you have nobody around so you can do steam workshop if you have nobody to have fun with. I also love how there are lobby levels you can choose and you can even download workshop lobby levels and at lobby levels your friends can have loads of fun at those types of levels depending on the level you select like the Christmas level has fun fireworks that you can use as a pvp (player versus player) and try to knock people off which is fun. If you have friends that can play this game I recommend playing with friends or if you don't have friends you can go to an online server but you may be forced to download whatever they downloaded from the workshop so be careful as always when you go online and also there is chat online so be careful if you are going to online because not everyone is a kind person but I haven't really seen mean people there but I am just warning you if you are at a young age online isn't always safe and it may be tempting because the game is boring without others but always be careful. Anyways back to the review! One of the things I love about this version is developer tools! If you are on keyboard and mouse (which I assume everyone is on when they are on the steam version) you can press the tilda key which is this key ` which is the key to the left of 1 to open up the console which you can type in all sorts of stuff but I don't really know any commands that really do anything but you are free to use the console and I don't think you can get banned for it at all because it is really hard to use and another thing I like a lot about the developer tools is freecam which I do know how to use and it's easy and can be used anywhere. You just press F8 while in game and you are in freecam mode! Just press F8 again to return to normal. The last thing you can do is hold , or . to raise/lower the fog level and you can get rid of fog or make it really foggy (I don't remember which one does which so you will have to press them to find out for me). Thanks for reading this review and I hope you find it helpful and I will turn on allow comments so you can all comment to this and tell me what you think or just chat and hang out at the comments. Anyways bye !\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc"

There are plenty of levels to choose from that come with the game, and a plethora of user created maps to add even more enjoyment. There are some issues here and there, but they're not game breaking. Best annoying example I have is when your characters arm gets stuck behind their head and you're not able to dislodge it without respawning. Again, not game breaking but annoying. Excitedly waiting for Human Fall Flat 2 to release(or even just have a release date), because I know it's going to be better than the first."

The grab mechanic seems a little unreliable at times (since the developers tweaked it to make climbing directly upwards more difficult), but nothing too offensive.\n\nThere are myriad high-quality community levels available on the workshop. Select submissions to the community level contests are periodically added into the main game as an official level (achievement hunters should note that they add new achievements for each added level).\n\nI recommend playing with friends. 76/100."

Puzzles and mechanics are very creative, each level hold different theme and different kind of mechanics and puzzles, comparing to other puzzle games I never really felt like alt f4 out of game XD strongly recommended to buy on sale, worth to play solo, I had a pretty fun time :) I would expect with friend it must be even more fun, but playing solo provides more of a challenge."

As I said before, the levels are difficult, so don't buy this game if you're not patient."

        "review": "A physics-based game about manoeuvring a wobbly person across a variety of levels featuring light platforming sections and puzzles.\n\n\nHuman: Fall Flat has you control an active ragdoll, which is able to walk, jump, flop over and extend either arm in order to grab onto stuff. Your character\u2019s reactions to inputs are physics-based and feel sluggish, making it rather awkward to control yourself. This, however, is by design, with the game having you fight with your own move set in order to complete its challenges. It also makes for some great fun to see your avatar awkwardly stumble and fall around.\n\nThe game features a large number of levels, each of which depicting a dream scape with a mostly unique theme. Early on, levels are quite short and serve more as a training ground to get you used to the controls, while the later dreamscapes are much more expansive, giving you plenty of set pieces to play around with. Each level has you traverse a mostly linear path, featuring checkpoints at regular intervals. You\u2019ll die when touching certain objects or when falling off the map, leaving you to respawn by being dropped from the sky above the most recent checkpoint.\n\nLevels are made up of light platforming sections interspersed with basic puzzles. While on their own, these tasks are rather benign, your wobbly character along with somewhat wonky physical interactions serve to make them decently challenging. These challenges can be quite janky at points, but mostly strike a good balance of difficulty and are surprisingly varied. Each level also features a set of achievements for completing certain optional tasks, giving you a reason to revisit them.\n\nHuman: Fall Flat can be played with another player in local split screen or with up to 8 players online, which makes things more chaotic and turns up the silliness, as a whole bunch of wobbly ragdolls stumble around and awkwardly interact. The game also features Steam Workshop support, giving you access to a giant number of additional levels. Some of these are genuinely wonderfully made, with unique aesthetics and mechanics, while others merely serve as thrown-together playgrounds for fooling around. Either way, this provided quite a few hours of additional fun for me and my friends. Recent updates to the game have even officially added some of the more polished community created maps to the stock level selection, giving some well-done incentive to return to Human: Fall Flat from time to time.\n\nThe character you play as is customizable, giving you a range of head and body types along with the ability to freely draw on and colour them. Like with the levels, custom avatars are also available from the Steam Workshop, giving you a range of more or less good-looking renditions of characters from other media.\n\nGraphically, Human: Fall Flat goes for a rather minimal aesthetic, that's fitting and honestly pleasant. More recently added levels tend to feature some noticeable inconsistencies, especially when it comes to particle effects but mostly form a coherent package. Sound-wise, the game features some basic yet wonderful instrumentals playing at certain points in levels, which very much oppose the silly, chaotic gameplay, yet somehow perfectly fit the game.\n\nOn a more negative note, sound effects tend to be rather jarring and are missing entirely for some actions. Combined with limited soundscapes, this can often lead to the game being way to silent once the music stops, exaggerating the jarring nature of some of the sound effects. Additionally, positional audio seems to be quite buggy when playing in split-screen, seemingly only playing for one of the players or seemingly cutting out completely at certain points.\n\n\nWhile there are some technical shortcomings that I'd wish would be resolved, I genuinely love this game and have many fond memories of fooling about in it with my friends, which I can only recommend.\n\nNote: Some of the community maps officially added recently feature rather impactful bugs which are well-documented but were never addressed, all the while new levels keep getting added. I consider this a needless smudge on an otherwise great game, that's sadly unlikely to be addressed."

Every few months the game gets an update and I discover I no longer finished the game and got 4 new achievements to get. Yes, I'm a completionist! (And I'm proud of it!)\n\nThe game mechanics are purposefully clunky, which is fun for ragdoll effects and for a few levels. But when you simply try to finish the level it gets highly irritating and annoying. Especially when combined with glitches, such as getting stuck to the point you have to reload the last checkpoint.\nThe puzzles aren't that hard, it is the controls that make you lose your mind because you already tried this swing for 15 times or this precision jump with a blob of a character.\n\nThe point is, it sure starts out fun, but right now the gameplay is equal to suffering if you aim for 100% completion."

        "review": "\"Human: Fall Flat\" is an engaging and quirky physics-based puzzle platformer developed by No Brakes Games. The game places players in control of Bob, a featureless human character, who must navigate surreal, dreamlike levels filled with puzzles and obstacles. What sets this game apart is its use of realistic physics and intentionally wobbly controls, creating a uniquely challenging and often hilarious experience.\n\nThe game's charm lies in its simplicity and the creativity required to solve puzzles. Players must manipulate objects, pull levers, and use the environment to progress, often resulting in slapstick comedy as Bob flails and tumbles through each level. The open-ended nature of the puzzles encourages experimentation and multiple solutions, making each playthrough feel fresh and rewarding.\n\n\"Human: Fall Flat\" also shines in its multiplayer mode, allowing up to eight players to collaborate (or compete) in solving puzzles. This adds an extra layer of fun and chaos, as players work together to navigate the whimsical landscapes.\n\nVisually, the game boasts a minimalist, cartoon-like art style that is both charming and functional. The simplicity of the design keeps the focus on the physics-based gameplay and the humorous antics of Bob.\n\nOverall, \"Human: Fall Flat\" is a delightful game that combines clever puzzle design with laugh-out-loud moments, making it a joy to play alone or with friends. Its unique blend of physics-based mechanics and open-ended puzzle-solving ensures that it remains a favorite among fans of lighthearted, creative games."

My balls are now flat. See the resemblance? Mind blown. Step aside Matpat, let a REAL gamer theorize about this one.\n\n\nThis game IS pretty deep despite being the typical \"Funny hee hee haha le epic troll\" game. I liked the part where you're needed to drive the car down the road. Though, me being the silly goose I was, swerved off the road and we all fell off the map. This also correlates with the fact that sometimes I want to swerve off the road in my 2022 Honda civic\u2122 so I can kill off me and my \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 wife. I hate her.

        "review": "Ahh, yes. Human Fall Flat. But the question is: are we human? In the game, we are basically what I can only describe as an anthropomorphic blob. Even if we take damage or \"fall flat,\" nothing actually happens. I speculate that we're a sort of clay golem created with the intent of creating a pseudo-reality TV show, akin to something like Wipeout back in the day. This is further solidified by the fact that we are constantly moved into seemingly unconnected environments, as if they're completely seperate cages that our \"master\" puts us in. To put it simply, this scares me. Not knowing if what you're doing has any point or if any of it is real. I could be in a reality TV show for peoples amusement, but I could also not be. I don't know what scares me more; the possibility of TECHNICALLY having a purpose (in this situation being entertaining others), or being a cog in a mindless machine. Just happening to be there. Oh god. What if there really is no purpose to these adventures? What if all the parkour and tribulations actually has no meaning? No onlookers. No pat on the back from dad saying I did a good job. Ahh...my father. Speaking of my father: he was a mysterious man. He didn't talk much with our family, and I wasn't really sure he was my father until I was 7. For lack of a better word, he was absent. He'd come home sometimes at 3 in the morning, sometimes not at all. To this day, I wonder where my father used to go. Heh.. Still, it doesn't really matter. He left me and my mother when I was old enough to not be a boy, but not young enough to be a man. Ahh...13. What an age. Coincidentally, 13 is when I started developing feelings for this girl named Joesephina Linguina. She was a real bombshell. And by bombshell I mean a literal bomb. You see, I live in a highly developed underground pseudo-futuristic society. Poor Joesephina lost her belly button at a young age and had to replace it with a highly futuristic bomb. Ahhh...Forgive my rambling!\nAnyways, back to the review.\nQuite a fun game, I must say. Especially when you play with friends. Hehe, especially the lady ones. I love girls. Girls love me. What can I say?\nFinal score 1/10"

Way more frustrating than it should be. I shouldnt have to fight with a mechanic of the game to get it to work, but alas, human fall flat, falls completely flat in that regard. need a sticky hands mod and this game might be playable. Such a simple fix but now u have to fight with the game and your toddler character to try to beat these levels. Almost fun."

Chill music and simple graphics for a relaxed time.\nThe physics work really well, which is important for a physics puzzler.\nGreat to play with friends, with lots of opportunities for jolly co-operation and devious trickery for good natured messing with buds.\nThe game got a ton of updates for over 5 years after release.\nBeautifully realized worlds with unique mechanics and art styles.\nA low skill floor, but a fairly high skill ceiling. Challenge yourself by trying to find what puzzles you can skip.\nThe player characters are adorable little blobs that you can have express themselves with such emotions as: running at something with both hands raised in celebration, flopping over to take a nap, and many more."

        "review": "Positive Aspects\n\n\"Human Fall Flat\" is a quirky physics-based puzzle platformer that stands out for its unique gameplay and charming aesthetic. One of the game's most significant strengths is its innovative physics system, which allows for creative and often humorous interactions with the environment. Players control a wobbly human character, navigating through various dream-like levels that require manipulating objects and solving puzzles to progress. The floppy, often clumsy mechanics of character movement add a layer of challenge and entertainment that is both engaging and endearing.\n\nThe game shines particularly brightly when played in cooperative mode. Teaming up with friends adds an extra layer of fun and chaos, as players must work together to tackle the puzzles. This can lead to hilarious situations, making \"Human Fall Flat\" a fantastic choice for group play sessions. The cooperative element not only makes the puzzles more dynamic but also enhances the overall enjoyment through shared experiences and teamwork.\n\nMoreover, the visual style of \"Human Fall Flat\" is simplistic yet effective, with a minimalist approach that focuses on the gameplay experience. The levels are thoughtfully designed, with a variety of themes and mechanics that keep the game feeling fresh and interesting as players progress. Each level introduces new concepts and challenges, which helps to maintain a sense of discovery and anticipation throughout the game.\n\nNegative Aspects\n\nHowever, \"Human Fall Flat\" has some drawbacks that might detract from its appeal for certain players. One issue is the control scheme, which some players find frustratingly imprecise and difficult to master. The intentionally awkward controls, while a source of humor and challenge, can also lead to moments of irritation, especially during more intricate puzzles where precision is key. This can lead to a feeling of tedium and frustration, particularly for players who prefer more straightforward and responsive control systems.\n\nAdditionally, the game's pacing can sometimes feel slow, particularly in solo play. Without the chaotic and lively element of cooperative play, the game's flaws become more apparent, including repetitive puzzle mechanics and a lack of narrative drive. The game does not offer a strong story or character development, which can make the gameplay feel aimless and monotonous over extended periods.\n\n\"Human Fall Flat\" also suffers from a lack of content once the available levels are completed. Although the game supports community-created levels, the quality and ingenuity of these can vary significantly. Players looking for a consistently curated experience may find the game's longevity limited once they have explored the initial set of challenges.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, \"Human Fall Flat\" offers a unique and entertaining experience with its physics-based puzzles and cooperative gameplay. It is particularly enjoyable when played with friends, where the game's quirky mechanics and challenges can be fully appreciated. However, the game's control scheme and pacing might not appeal to everyone, potentially leading to moments of frustration. Despite these issues, \"Human Fall Flat\" remains a memorable and fun game that is worth exploring for those who enjoy creative problem-solving and have a good sense of humor about occasional gameplay quirks."

So there's probably more to the game than I've seen, however after 24 levels, I think I've had enough.

Mostly, yes!\nMost of the levels in this game can be skipped or solved \"incorrectly\" simply by climbing around in the right way, and you can bunnyhop to gain a lot of speed. Sounds like a good speedrunner's game to me.\nOnly complaint I can think of is that some achievements take a *while* to complete, such as \"Radio Silence\" which requires you to throw all the radios off the \"Factory\" level. One of them is hidden behind a one-way portal, and if you accidentally go through the portal? You need to do *everything* before it again, assuming you are playing by yourself. And other achievements don't even have level names tied to them, meaning you have to either guess which level it comes from, or look up a guide."

A high level of patience is required, especially at the beginning, because it takes time to become familiar with how things work and even then it is slow to carry out simple tasks. But if you're able to remain calm and relaxed after trying to do the same thing over and over again, failing every time, and still keep going, then it can be very rewarding. Much more fun with friends, of course."

        "review": "Human Fall Flat is a veritable laugh riot, with escapades that still tickle my funny bone years later. In terms of content, this game is a bottomless treasure trove, regularly updated with fresh challenges to tackle. Though I must say, completing it seems akin to chasing a mirage as new achievements keep cropping up.\n\nIn a genre teeming with contenders, Human Fall Flat stands out with its comical antics, allowing players to flop around like beached seals, react in absurd ways, and even play possum when the occasion calls. The plethora of maps and challenges, coupled with mod support, further enriches the experience.\n\nBut here's the rub for prospective buyers: local co-op requires a delicate dance between gamepad and keyboard, while mingling with online players can be akin to waltzing with wild stallions\u2014expect the unexpected. As for the rumor mill, alas, Linux users are left out in the cold, and while some may brand it the dullest thing since watching paint dry, I daresay they're missing the point. Operating the game might pose a challenge, but then again, not everyone is cut from the same cloth."

        "review": "FIRSTLY, Human Fall Flat 2 is coming out, don't know when but it is, so probably hold for it, otherwise:\n\nEither you wanna have a weekend game to play with friends or 100% solo, or both, this is a good game. Very cozy game as well.\n\nMore of review:\nThe size of the game is 5G, very good. Graphics are good since they are very simple, so the difference between Very Low and Ultra is little, noticeable, but little, so performance and video quality should be crisp for everyone. As far as controls, levels, exploration and puzzles, they all fit together nicely, only one note for the music.\nIt is very chill and good, but if you take too long in a part of a level, then the music fades away and you are left with silence. Not so much of a problem, since you can think much better with silence to solve the puzzle or traverse the environment, maybe with some ambient music or melody it would be better but no big deal.\nAs I mentioned, very cozy, chill and simple game to play through, and at the right time, it can get a bit creepy in certain places. Also, mod support, so you and your friends can play as your favorite politicians and leaders, such as Erdogan.\nLastly, 100%-ing the game. The developers, actually cared about the achievements, so if you just breezed through the levels and you felt like the game was too short, try to 100% the game. How I know they cared?\n1) The majority of the achievements demand you to explore more of a level, as a result, you reveal new\nways to beat a level or solve a puzzle, and you find new areas, aka. more game.\n2) Obscure and challenging stuff such as driving a dump truck down a windy road or quickly climbing a\ntower can reward you with an achievement. More exploration and overachieving, more game.\n3) Each level roughly has 4-6 achievements, independent of each-other, with the majority of them being\nreasonable with what they demand. More replay-ability, so more game.\n4) Knowing that the achievements are well designed, you will start trying out various stuff in the levels to see if they reward you with an achievement. For example:\nIn a level, you operate an RC car, specifically a pick-up truck, and in the same area you can obtain 3 batteries, and i noticed that they can nicely fit in the back of the truck, so i collected them, aligned everything, put the batteries in the back, and... nothing. Did i get an achievement? No. Did I have fun with my own curiosity? Yes. Is this review to long? Yes, i haven't hit the character limit and I have some time to spare."

        "review": "To be honest, I lack the hand-eye coordination to get past some of the levels in this game and because of that, even though I enjoy the puzzles, I don't think I would like playing it on my own. However, I've had a LOT of fun playing this with friends! Bumbling around this world with companions is very entertaining. I've probably never laughed as hard while playing a game as I did in this one. Some game moments still make me laugh when I think about them years later.\n\nHuman Fall Flat is regularly updated with new content and I haven't played in a while so there's lots of levels I haven't even seen yet. Lots of achievements to collect if you're into that, though I suppose it can't really be completed if new ones are added all the time."

Especially hard for a single player."

There is an option to disable it, but it don't do anything, I can feel whiplash every time my camera centers.

If you are planning to buy it, I recommend that you agree with some friends to buy it. It can give you lots of laughs with friends, but playing alone just feels empty. The feeling of it being empty may come from the music too, as the music is calm in a weird lonely type of way. It still can be fun alone but not for long periods of times. Other than that, amazing game, by far, this game has given me memory\u2019s from the times I used to play it four years ago, which doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but it really was. This was one of my first if not the first steam game I have had and played, so this game lives in my heart and I hope it continues living."

        "review": "This is one of the most frustrating games I've ever played, and it doesn't even have to do with the puzzles. Those were great. It's my favorite genre. The movement mechanics of your character are the real problem. Your character is like Gumby - boneless. Arms flailing about, body torquing forward and back, your hands constantly missing picking up an objective; who thought this would be enjoyable? If you want to make the game difficult, put it into the problem solving aspect and not some wonky, wobbly character design that makes it difficult to pick up anything with both hands. On top of that, your camera angle is tied to your movements, so your camera can constantly bob in and out through your character and the environment. The music in this game is very sparse and uninspiring. It felt like the last thing they just threw in there. But even with that, if the devs had just kept the character a regular one that you use to solve puzzles, this would be a thumbs up. I can't recommend this and I won't check out the upcoming sequel. It's a shame."

        "review": "I played this with my niece who was more interested in throwing me off ledges and causing chaos than solving puzzles, but still, the game presents a good number of fun and memorable challenges. There were a few times it felt like we bypassed a big chunk of a map accidentally, given a lack of clear objectives and areas that went untouched, and the wobbly character/camera can get a bit nauseating, but overall it's worthy of a play. We invested about 13 hours including all the time my niece spent choosing her outfit.\n\nGrab a partner (or several) and enjoy."

        "review": "\u201cHuman: Fall Flat \u2013 A Physics-Based Adventure with a Lone Hero\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Entry Log 666: Doom Slayer\u2019s Review\n\nBackground Noise: Heavy metal riff, chainsaw revving, demon growls\n\nListen up, fellow physics enthusiasts and floppy adventurers! The Doom Slayer here, fresh from ripping apart Hell\u2019s finest and saving countless dimensions. But today, I\u2019m not wielding my trusty Super Shotgun\u2014I\u2019m wielding my keyboard. It\u2019s time to unravel the quirky world of Human: Fall Flat, where puzzles defy logic, controls trip over their own shoelaces, and my social life is as empty as a pixelated void.\n\nThe Physics Playground \ud83c\udf10\ud83d\udd0d\nHuman: Fall Flat is a slapstick physics puzzle game that defies reason and embraces chaos. You control a featureless, pudgy character stumbling through dreamlike environments. Picture this: wobbly bridges, precarious platforms, and objects that behave like drunken squirrels. Your goal? Solve puzzles by manipulating the wonky physics. It\u2019s like trying to fold origami during an earthquake. And the best part? You can play solo or invite friends. But more on that later.\n\nThe Lone Hero \ud83d\udcfb\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f\nAs our doughy protagonist, you\u2019ll tumble, flop, and faceplant your way through surreal landscapes. His animations are a symphony of clumsiness\u2014like a toddler learning to walk on a tightrope. And yes, he has a buttcrack (because why not?). You can even customize him using MS Paint-style tools. Want a superhero cape? Done. How about a monocle and a handlebar mustache? Go wild. But here\u2019s the twist: I don\u2019t have any friends to play with. My social circle is emptier than a deflated balloon. So, I venture forth alone, laughing at my own missteps and celebrating each wonky victory.\n\nPuzzles, Laughter, and the Void \ud83c\udfad\ud83c\udf1f\nHuman: Fall Flat\u2019s charm lies in its absurdity. You\u2019ll wrestle with levers, swing on ropes, and stack boxes like a deranged Tetris master. And when you finally conquer a puzzle, it feels like winning the lottery\u2014except the prize is more physics puzzles. But here\u2019s the bittersweet truth: I\u2019m always happy to meet new people to play with. If you\u2019re out there, fellow adventurers, let\u2019s unravel the mysteries together. Because in this pixelated world, even a lone hero can find camaraderie.\n\nDoom Slayer\u2019s Verdict: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (Four BFG blasts out of five)\n\nDisclaimer: No demons were harmed during the writing of this review. But my inner klutz? Yeah, it\u2019s doing cartwheels. \ud83e\udd38\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83c\udfae"

I remember first playing this some time in 2016 or 2017, back when I was only around 9 years old. I would play with my best friend at the time, David, and sometimes I'd play with my brother. It was one of the most fun games we played, and since my best friend moved away a few years ago, this game holds an extremely special place in my heart. Earlier today, I realized that even though I've played hundreds of hours across Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC, I've never actually seen the ending to the game. I decided that I had nothing better to do and decided to finally see the ending after so long. I had no idea how emotional I would be when i beat it, but after 7 years it made me cry like I've never cried to a game before. I am still tearing up at all of the memories this game gave me with my best friends and family, and I don't think I would be who I am today without it."

Grieving, I found solace in the virtual world of Human Fall Flat, a whimsical game that unexpectedly became my lifeline.\n\nThrough its charming puzzles and quirky physics, Human Fall Flat offered me not just a distraction, but a new perspective on life. As I navigated the game's whimsical landscapes alongside my children, laughter replaced tears, and joy slowly began to fill the void left by loss.\n\nWith each puzzle conquered and each silly mishap shared with my kids, I rediscovered the simple pleasures of companionship and play. Human Fall Flat became more than just a game; it became a catalyst for healing and a beacon of hope for brighter days ahead.\n\nIn the end, Human Fall Flat taught me that even in the darkest of times, there's always a glimmer of light waiting to guide us back to happiness. And for that, I'll forever be grateful."

It may be another awkwardly controlled game with a robust physics system, but neither is overbearing enough to drag down the game's enjoyment factor. It comes in at a good length, there are multiple ways to solve puzzles, and the co-op really makes things enjoyable."

        "review": "This game is hilarious and a blast to play with friends. Or honestly even to play with randos. I don't say that often either. Usually games that allow you to play co-op with random people are games that I will strictly play with friends. I don't like playing with random people. Random people are \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.\n\nThat being said... random people can still be \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 in this game.... BUT it's the good clean fun kind of thing. I play with my son and he has a thing for yeeting people off of cliffs. Sometimes he'll actually do the puzzles, but most of the time I'm LITERALLY dragging him through the level. It's still fun though and still hilarious.\n\nThe puzzles you do aren't half bad either. Some I've really been stumped on until a random person hops in and does it and I feel like an idiot lol.\n\nI will say that this is one of the swing-a-ling ragdoll physics kind of games. So if you don't like those kinds of controls you won't like this game. The wonky controls are part of the fun, but if you don't find that fun this game will be an absolute nightmare for you.\n\nA good point of reference is something like Gang Beasts, which has very similar physics and controls.\n\nThe game also continues to get support from the devs and they add new levels here and again. Great to have a dev that still gives love to such an old game.\n\nEnd thing, this game is a great game to pick up for a laugh or for a fun time with friends or family (and to maybe test some friendships)."

And the usual outcome is me getting send back to the checkpoint. Also, the autosave is scuffed. Sometimes it doesn't work the first time, so I either lose progress or by some miracle I get to the next checkpoint first try."

        "review": "\"Human Fall Flat\" is a very.. odd title (in a good sense). The game has gained a very large following in the past 7 years, but this popularity will not affect my criticism. I absolutely love the silly rag-doll style this game has and it's puzzle aspect is really well done. I've been playing this game for years on console and i'm coming up on 10 hours on Steam spent on this game in two days. I've really been grinding the achievements, so far I have 70/122 achievements completed and I haven't gotten bored of the grind, so far it seems like a relatively fun and mildly hard game to 100% but the challenge keeps it interesting. Keep up the great work, amazing updates, and maps No Brakes Games, and Curve Games!!!"

The music I so good it rivals Minecraft music, the controls take a bit to get used to but when you get it, it\u2019s easy to climb walls and pick up things!\nI got this game on the switch first and playing it with my siblings was so fun! So when it went on sale I got it and it\u2019s been amazing! Definitely recommend!"

The controls are way more frustrating than fun, and the whole thing feels less like a game and more like something for streamers to monetise.\n\nIf you\u2019re just a regular person wanting to play a fun and funny game, even with friends, there\u2019s WAY better physics based games out there than this one."

Not sure if those tricks are intentional, but all part of the fun anyway."

No pressure just relax and have fun. All the maps and puzzles are awesome. And the best thing about it is that the developers are constantly giving updates and new maps for us to have fun. I'm also excited about HFF2!"

        "review": "One of, if not the most fun game to play with your friends. It has something for every person, whether you're competitive or laid back. Whether you like to play seriously or to troll. It hits every spot and it wouldn't be an easy task to find a gamer who wouldn't enjoy playing it.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it's the easy to learn, hard to master type. But once you get the hang of it, you can even do some stuff beyond what you're supposed to. Basically sometimes you even get to \"cheat\" and skip some checkpoints if you prefer speedrunning on maps. The physics of the game is really well done. It's capable of producing some of the funniest moments you'll ever see in a video game. Boy, If i had a nickle for every time I laughed my *** off.\n\n7 years later and the game is still getting updated with new levels, have to appreciate devs who are like that. Not to mention that the workshop is also very good and there's plenty of community made levels who are really just as good as the official ones. Even the lobbies can be a lot of fun.\n\nAll this, of course, granted you have friends to play with. It's really not meant to be a single-player game. That should be the only concern you have if you're on the fence of buying it. When it's on a sale, it's really as good as it gets bang for the buck. But it's definitely worth the full price as well."

        "review": "I love this game. From the physics based puzzles and platforming, to the chaotic co-op shenanigans, Human Fall Flat is a blast. The soundtrack is simply beautiful and I love the way the (mostly) serious music contrasts with the silly nature of the game. It really makes you feel like you're on a grand adventure with your friends, despite all the stupidity going on. The levels are all varied with all sorts of quirks and gimmicks, but the best part is you can get creative and solve them any way you like by using physics and the tools the game provides you with. I had a great time achievement hunting in this game with my friend. Some of the achievements are actually quite tricky to get, so this provides a fun additional challenge once you've played all the levels. That being said, the developers don't seem to stop creating more even 7 years after the game's release. There's also the workshop which adds a potentially endless supply of community made content to play. Looking to the future I'm very excited to see what the sequel has in store!"

Once you understand how the controls are supposed to work, you quickly get the hang of what you're supposed to do. This game is 100% worth buying imo."

Want to explore something different alone while the other players do something else? Sure! Need to go afk for a few minutes to make a tea without feeling stressed to miss out? No problem, either.\n\nVery relaxed, and also very fun. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzles based on a physics engine."

It's like playing a ragdoll version of The Matrix, where dodging bullets is replaced with comically stumbling over your own feet.\n\nThe graphics are intentionally clumsy, making the characters look like they were designed by a three-year-old with a fondness for wobbly stick figures. It's like the developers handed the art duties to a preschooler and said, \"Go wild!\"\n\nThe gameplay is a slapstick ballet of clumsy maneuvers and unintentional acrobatics. It's like watching a puppeteer who forgot how strings work, resulting in an endearing dance of chaos.\n\nIn conclusion, this is not just a game; it's a hilarious journey through a world where gravity is more of a suggestion than a rule. So, grab your floppy character, embrace the chaos, and get ready for a slapstick adventure that's more entertaining than a barrel of wobbly monkeys."

It's the kind of game where even the simplest task, like opening a door or climbing a ladder, becomes a sidesplitting performance. As you grapple with physics-defying puzzles and try to coordinate your character's flailing movements, you'll find yourself in a perpetual state of chuckles. The beauty lies in its absurdity; it's a playground where chaos reigns and laughter thrives. Each stumble, flop, and misstep is a comedic gem, making \"Human Fall Flat\" an experience that'll leave you grinning from ear to ear long after you've closed the game."

In my many hours of funny clay people game, I have found that it is best to be one of those people who either just stopped playing all together or turned it into a 3d forum, as they often have the best experience, and that getting really good simply gives you a feeling of isolation from a majority of the player base and leaves you with feelings of inferiority knowing that there will always be someone vastly better than you.\n\nOver all 8/10 with friends, 6.5/10 alone.\nFunny clay people game."

When you first play it maybe you'll get a hard time to adjust and find the keys to drag and jump around but hang in there. The graphic is pretty smooth even in my potato laptop and it has a pretty good challenge (which I actually had a hard time thank God I have my friends). Buy it only if you have friend to play bcs honestly playing it alone will be boring."

        "review": "Don't let the presentation fool you, this is a legitimately interesting and fun puzzle game. You might be inclined to believe this falls in line with other games like Overcooked or Moving Out, but the formula for this game isn't chaotic arcade like with those, but far more puzzle focused, despite this, it still retains alot of the multiplayer fun from those games. The way the puzzles work in this game are pretty simple in that your objective is always to move forward, with a focus on the physics system paired with the intentionally unconventional control scheme. The difficulty to progress strikes a really good balance between 'easy enough to not give up' and 'difficult enough to feel rewarding upon completion' and I do get excited to play the next level. The aforementioned 'unconventional' control scheme may be frustrating at first, but (at least with mouse and keyboard) I found myself getting used to it decently early on. The biggest strength, and perhaps the biggest weakness of this game is its focus on co-op. All of the puzzles are designed to be possible with just one player, but it moves at a slower pace which makes it a good bit less fun, most importantly however, if you choose to play alone you will be missing out on how fun this game is with friends. The game allows you to choose to try and figure out the puzzles together and try to progress, or you can choose to sandbag your friends instead. This does make the game a bit dependant on the people you play it with, because if theres 3 of you and 1 person is exclusively trying to sandbag, it isn't that fun, but if people are good natured about it (which my friend group generally is) then this is a really fun mechanic. Also, the fact that this game allows for 8 players makes it an instant recommendation for friend groups looking to play something together. You might think this would be too chaotic but in my experience, when playing with about 6 players at most, the levels are large enough for it to not feel cramped and the puzzles might go by a bit faster than usual, but it's still very enjoyable.\n\nOverall, if you're interested in giving this game a go with some friends, I can't recommend it enough."

        "review": "Human: Fall Flat - Unpredictable Physics Fun\n\nPlaying \"Human: Fall Flat,\" I couldn't help but draw comparisons with games like Ubisoft's \"Grow Home\" and Boneloaf's \"Gang Beasts.\" This quirky physics-based puzzler seems to follow in the same wobbly footsteps as these titles, but it manages to carve out its own unique charm.\n\nIn \"Grow Home,\" you guide a wobbly robot named BUD as he uses physics to solve puzzles and climb a giant plant. \"Gang Beasts\" features blobby characters wobbling around, employing physics for multiplayer brawls. Now, in \"Human: Fall Flat,\" you control a blobby character named Bob, who's equally unsteady on his feet and uses physics to tackle puzzles and navigate through various rooms.\n\nAt first, I was a bit skeptical. The initial levels felt derivative and somewhat clumsy compared to its peers. Bob, with his blank expression and featureless appearance, didn't immediately win me over like BUD did in \"Grow Home.\" However, my opinion took a turn once I got the hang of climbing.\n\nBob's animations, initially clumsy, suddenly appeared endearing as I learned to manipulate his independently controlled arms for climbing. The whole process, from jumping a gap to raising Bob's hands above his head and then running toward the edge, became oddly satisfying. It was as if I'd stumbled upon the secret to making Bob lovably daft, and I found myself rooting for him.\n\nBut here's where \"Human: Fall Flat\" veers into subjective territory. While BUD in \"Grow Home\" had a clear goal of reaching the top of a giant plant, Bob's objectives are less defined. You're not entirely sure where you're going, except that each sprawling level eventually leads to your plummeting to the next one. For BUD, it felt urgent and desperate; for Bob, it's more casual, albeit entertaining. Whether you find this patience-testing or not largely depends on your mood at any given moment.\n\nThe game's ability to let you improvise solutions is undeniably rewarding. Some puzzles have multiple solutions, and the game's open-ended approach often leads to unexpected ways of solving them. It's immensely satisfying to think outside the box, even if the game sometimes interprets your antics as being stuck and drops a hint.\n\nMy affection for \"Human: Fall Flat\" oscillated between delight and annoyance. The later levels, with their vibrant colors and character, provided a lovely contrast to the initial blandness. Yet, I occasionally found myself frustrated by Bob's unwieldy movements and wished for more straightforward controls.\n\nIn the end, \"Human: Fall Flat\" exudes charm and offers genuine fun, as long as you can endure its unpredictably goofy physics. It's a natural evolution of the \"Grow Home\" concept, successfully making it their own. And that climbing animation? It's simply delightful."

        "review": "Human: Fall Flat adalah game yang bagus untuk dibeli saat dijual. Mainkan secara tunggal, online, atau undang teman dan mainkan secara split screen. Kontrol yang sederhana dipasangkan dengan gumpalan karakter yang kurang responsif berarti Anda berdua akan belajar dengan kecepatan yang sama. Bermain-mainlah di taman bermain yang telah disediakan, raih pencapaian, atau naik level. Selesaikan tugas secara bersamaan, lakukan sesuatu secara terpisah, atau saling membantu. Lakukan apa yang kamu inginkan dengan urutan yang kamu suka. Jarang sekali saya tertawa terbahak-bahak saat memecahkan teka-teki bersama teman-teman saya. Kontrolnya jenaka dan canggung, yang membuat tugas-tugas sederhana seperti memanjat dan membingungkan menjadi sangat sulit - dan lucu. Beberapa jam yang menyenangkan dan sangat direkomendasikan!"

And has really cool knick-knacks in each level, the levels have different routes you can take and the game insists you use any sort of way to beat the levels. You don't nessecarily need to use a box to help you do this, do that, and blah blah. It is important to note the interesting sound design, with metal pipe sound effects, soft plastic hitting the ground, the pitter patter of your goofy ahh feet. The puzzles in this game do not require ainstein levels of intelligence but they can be challenging if need be. It can be a silly platformer with those sticky hands of yours and again, very fun."

But then you start to realize the difficulty in this game does not come from challenging puzzles or interesting twists, but instead from clunky controls. Its not that the jumps or lifts or lock or anything like that are difficult to figure out, but that the controls regularly don't work properly. You often cannot tell what you are grabbed on to, its difficult to control whatever you've picked up or are moving.\n\nThis difficult part of a parkour-esque game should be in solving what to do and where to go or in working to execute difficult jumps or climbs. It should not come from broken clunky faulty controls. Idky this isn't standard thinking in 2023."

        "review": "Human: Fall Flat - Unpredictable Physics Fun\n\nPlaying \"Human: Fall Flat,\" I couldn't help but draw comparisons with games like Ubisoft's \"Grow Home\" and Boneloaf's \"Gang Beasts.\" This quirky physics-based puzzler seems to follow in the same wobbly footsteps as these titles, but it manages to carve out its own unique charm.\n\nIn \"Grow Home,\" you guide a wobbly robot named BUD as he uses physics to solve puzzles and climb a giant plant. \"Gang Beasts\" features blobby characters wobbling around, employing physics for multiplayer brawls. Now, in \"Human: Fall Flat,\" you control a blobby character named Bob, who's equally unsteady on his feet and uses physics to tackle puzzles and navigate through various rooms.\n\nAt first, I was a bit skeptical. The initial levels felt derivative and somewhat clumsy compared to its peers. Bob, with his blank expression and featureless appearance, didn't immediately win me over like BUD did in \"Grow Home.\" However, my opinion took a turn once I got the hang of climbing.\n\nBob's animations, initially clumsy, suddenly appeared endearing as I learned to manipulate his independently controlled arms for climbing. The whole process, from jumping a gap to raising Bob's hands above his head and then running toward the edge, became oddly satisfying. It was as if I'd stumbled upon the secret to making Bob lovably daft, and I found myself rooting for him.\n\nBut here's where \"Human: Fall Flat\" veers into subjective territory. While BUD in \"Grow Home\" had a clear goal of reaching the top of a giant plant, Bob's objectives are less defined. You're not entirely sure where you're going, except that each sprawling level eventually leads to your plummeting to the next one. For BUD, it felt urgent and desperate; for Bob, it's more casual, albeit entertaining. Whether you find this patience-testing or not largely depends on your mood at any given moment.\n\nThe game's ability to let you improvise solutions is undeniably rewarding. Some puzzles have multiple solutions, and the game's open-ended approach often leads to unexpected ways of solving them. It's immensely satisfying to think outside the box, even if the game sometimes interprets your antics as being stuck and drops a hint.\n\nMy affection for \"Human: Fall Flat\" oscillated between delight and annoyance. The later levels, with their vibrant colors and character, provided a lovely contrast to the initial blandness. Yet, I occasionally found myself frustrated by Bob's unwieldy movements and wished for more straightforward controls.\n\nIn the end, \"Human: Fall Flat\" exudes charm and offers genuine fun, as long as you can endure its unpredictably goofy physics. It's a natural evolution of the \"Grow Home\" concept, successfully making it their own. And that climbing animation? It's simply delightful."

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

It's quite a simple game, too and has no really advanced graphics (not in a bad way). Quite fun to play with friends.\n\nMy only downsides are:\n1. There is no cross platform play (e.g People who bought Windows store version cannot play with people who bought Steam version)\n2. Characters can sometimes glitch out and have for example one leg gone (or when I was playing online, my character got totally stuck and could not move)\n3. Most of the \"levels\" that other people make are in a foreign language and cannot be read by somebody who does not know said foreign language. I would like for the game to have an inbuilt level editor, so that players can edit levels more easily and so that level making is more accessible, especially to platforms outside the Steam version, since for PS4 and Windows store version, there is no community levels."

        "review": "While I see how Human: Fall Flat could be a lot of fun in multiplayer, especially doing custom levels, the singleplayer gameplay just doesn't do it for me. I realize it's a physics game and that this is intentional, but the player character's lack of maneuverability is inherently frustrating. While the puzzles aren't conceptually difficult, it's not particularly fun to be stuck in a level for a technical reason, even though you've identified the route out and the mechanism by which to get there. It's also easy to get physically stuck on or behind objects. In a group, that frustration can sometimes be funny.\n\nThat's not to say this game isn't worthwhile or interesting. I didn't find the puzzles particularly engaging to begin with, but this game isn't really about complicated puzzles: it's about failing to do basic human motion properly (and having fun with that). Admittedly, it is fun at first, even in singleplayer. The physics engine and its whole \"flinging yourself around\" approach is amusing. It was neat to think about individually coordinating each of your hands to grab objects, climb, move things, etc. Perhaps this is how toddlers feel every day.\n\nStill, it didn't do it for me. An additional pain point is that the way the camera moves is at best disorienting and at worst nausea-inducing. (I don't typically get motion sickness in video games either.) I wasn't engaged by the narrator's remarks and the soundtrack felt out of place. The graphics are intentionally low-poly, and some of the levels are a bit cute, but I felt the plainness was lacking some artistic spark. Performance was perfectly good though!\n\nIf you want a game that lets you fool around with your friends, this is it! If you want a more technically playable puzzle game, there are more suitable options out there. Personally, just not my thing."

        "review": "Human Fall Flat : By Triple F\n\n\"Human: Fall Flat\", developed by No Brakes Games, is a physics-based puzzle platformer that throws you into the hilariously frustrating world of wobbly, customizable humans. With its simple controls and emphasis on teamwork, it's a game that's perfect for parties and creating unforgettable moments of shared laughter.\n\nThe core element of \"Human: Fall Flat\" lies in its physics engine. Your character, completely lacking in traditional jump buttons or complex controls, relies solely on grabbing and climbing to navigate the environment. This can be both a source of frustration and amusement. While the controls are undeniably simple, mastering them proves to be a hilarious challenge. Expect flailing limbs, unexpected tumbles, and moments where your carefully constructed human tower collapses in a fit of giggles.\n\nThe game offers a variety of levels with varying degrees of complexity, each presenting a unique puzzle that requires you to reach a specific goal. While you can attempt these solo, the true magic of \"Human: Fall Flat\" shines in its multiplayer mode. Playing with up to eight players online opens up a world of chaotic possibilities. Working together to solve puzzles becomes a hilarious exercise in communication and coordination, as you grapple, climb, and (often unintentionally) fling each other towards the objective. However, be warned: the game also lends itself to friendly sabotage, as players can easily send their teammates tumbling off ledges or into precarious situations, adding a layer of unpredictable humor to the experience.\n\n\"Human: Fall Flat\" allows for a surprising amount of character customization. You can choose from a variety of head shapes, body types, and outfits, allowing you to create your own unique \"wobbly human\" persona. While the customization don't affect gameplay, they add a layer of personality and humor to the experience, especially when viewed alongside the game's physics engine, where even the most serious-looking character can end up in a hilariously awkward situation.\n\nThe game's visual style is deceptively simple. The world is built from basic shapes and textures, with a focus on functionality over visual fidelity. However, this minimalist approach perfectly complements the game's core gameplay. The lack of visual clutter allows players to focus on the physics and the hilariously unpredictable movements of their characters, further enhancing the overall experience.\n\n\"Human: Fall Flat\" can also be completed individually in a few hours, depending on your skill and level of persistence. However, the game's true strength lies in its multiplayer functionality. Spending an evening with friends navigating the game's challenges and reveling in the shared laughter is where \"Human: Fall Flat\" truly shines.\n\nTo conclude, \"Human: Fall Flat\" is a unique and entertaining experience, particularly for those looking for a game to play with friends. The combination of simple controls, hilarious physics, and cooperative (or chaotically competitive) gameplay creates an experience that's both challenging and side-splitting. While the short length and potentially frustrating controls might not be for everyone, the game offers an undeniable charm and the potential for countless funny moments that will stay with you long after you finish the final level."

        "review": "It's like Dark Souls but because of puzzles and \"parkour\".\nYou try again and again, fail, fall, struggle until you complete one puzzle. And then there is the next one.\nThe game also lacks a bit of interesting gameplay mechanics for this length. You do pretty much the same at the end of the game as you did at the beginning.\nAlso even though the game features a local-coop mode there is absolutely no reason to play it in co-op. All the levels are designed to be completed solo so one of the players will probably get bored if the other one will be taking the initiative or will be better at climbing.\nThe music and the narrator's commentaries are very charming but there are so little of them in the game...\n\nBut otherwise - the game is good. A breathe of fresh air among all those conveyor made games. I'm not sure if I would be replaying it again or buying the second part, but the time I've spent in this game I definitely not regret spending."

Instead, the physics allow for such a multitude of possible (inelegant) solutions, none of them feel rewarding, and only result in \"phew, glad we made it through that stupid part\" sorts of feelings. The humour isn't very good either. Wouldn't really recommend this to anyone except the biggest lovers of silly physics-type stuff."

At the time of making this review, I have put 24 hours into it. With those hours, my friends and I had finished all of the included stages and about all of the well-built maps in its community workshop. Frankly, I thought we spent more time on this game. But it just goes to show how short its maps are. Nonetheless, the experience was enjoyable and there were a lot of maps that were truly satisfying to play and finish."

        "review": "Human: Fall Flat - Whimsical Physics Puzzles for Hilarious Creativity\n\nRating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nHuman: Fall Flat, released in 2016, invites players into a charming and surreal world of physics-based puzzles and goofy escapades. Developed by No Brakes Games, the game offers a unique blend of puzzle-solving, creativity, and lighthearted humor that results in an entertaining and often hilarious gameplay experience.\n\nThe central character, Bob, is a customizable and delightfully clumsy humanoid who stumbles and tumbles through a series of dreamlike levels. The game's physics-driven mechanics are intentionally wonky, leading to comical and unexpected interactions with the environment. This intentional quirkiness is at the heart of the game's charm and appeal.\n\nEach level of Human: Fall Flat is a sandbox of possibilities, tasking players with navigating intricate puzzles and obstacles. The game encourages creative problem-solving, allowing players to manipulate objects, climb surfaces, and experiment with the environment in their quest to reach the exit. The open-ended nature of the puzzles means that there are often multiple solutions, fostering a sense of accomplishment and ingenuity.\n\nThe cooperative multiplayer mode enhances the enjoyment, allowing you to tackle the challenges with friends. The chaotic and collaborative nature of solving puzzles together often results in hilarious outcomes, from inadvertently launching each other into the air to trying to coordinate complex maneuvers.\n\nHuman: Fall Flat's visual design is simple yet endearing, with its charmingly minimalistic environments and quirky character animations. The dreamlike settings, from ice caves to industrial complexes, offer a visually diverse and captivating backdrop for the puzzling adventures.\n\nThe game's humor is derived from the absurdity of the physics interactions and the ragdoll-like movements of the characters. Watching Bob stumble, flop, and flail through the environment is a constant source of amusement, and the unpredictability of the physics can lead to genuinely laugh-out-loud moments.\n\nDespite its strengths, Human: Fall Flat does have its limitations. The intentionally awkward controls and physics mechanics, while a defining feature of the game, can also lead to occasional frustration when precision is required. Additionally, the lack of a comprehensive narrative or progression system may limit its long-term appeal for some players.\n\nIn conclusion, Human: Fall Flat offers a delightful and entertaining blend of physics-based puzzles, creativity, and humor. Its charming visuals, open-ended gameplay, and cooperative multiplayer mode make it a standout choice for players seeking a unique and lighthearted gaming experience.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will tickle your funny bone and challenge your problem-solving skills in a whimsical and imaginative world, Human: Fall Flat is a delightful choice that promises laughter, creativity, and hours of engaging puzzle-solving fun."

        "review": "My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

        "review": "Human: Fall Flat is a unique puzzle game where the way to solve a puzzle isn't always clear, because the goal is to solve these puzzles however you would like. If you are new I recommend playing with friends, bonus points if on a voice call because it can be extremely funny when you see how athletic and wobbly these blob-shaped humans actually are.\n\nWhen you play, try not to keep asking yourself if the way you solved it is the intended solution, because the intended solution is to have fun and maybe even find an interesting workaround on the way, although I do agree that sometimes the intended solution is the best way because it stretches out the time you play this game, which is good because this game is very fun.\n\nUnless you speed-run, the game is kind of limited in the way that when you finish, the puzzles aren't as fun the second time when you already know how to solve them. Thankfully this is not that big of a problem though, because there is a lot of gameplay. When searching up the gameplay of Human: Fall Flat it says it takes 6 hours to complete, if focusing on the main objectives, and while I think that while this would be possible for a small group of new players to complete the main game this fast, it frankly would be a lot funner and easier to not rush through the dreams and to have a lot of fun. After the main dreams there are a bunch of 'extra' dreams, which usually have great themes (think 'City' or the new 'Miniature') and are sometimes bigger and/or better than the main levels. If I had to guess the average length of each dream for a new player, I would guess an average length of 2.5 (maybe 3?) hours. You could argue that some dreams take a lot shorter than that to complete, like the first level of the game, 'Mansion', which takes a new player around 5 minutes to complete, but those would cancel out with levels like 'Dark', that take closer to 4 hours for new players to complete. My estimate for the gameplay of Human: Fall Flat is 55-70 hours of gameplay (a good amount)\n\nIf you want to get a better idea of what Human: Fall Flat is like, definitely search up some play-throughs on youtube. I recommend Markiplier's play-through because even though he and his friends didn't finish it, it shows a very accurate way that new players play new levels and is also just very entertaining to watch..\n\nFor new players, the biggest tip I can give you is in movement: If you jump going diagonal (forward and left/right) you can jump a lot further than when jumping straight forward, and a run-up is more useful than you think. Also instead of wobbling around, if you hold forward and jump, and alternate every few jumps between left and right, you can go pretty fast and jump pretty far. After only a few jumps you go fast enough forward that you don't deviate that much left or right and it's not as hard to control as it sounds. Make sure that when running like this you have both arms pointed out to stabilise yourself. (not sure if this works when using a controller because I use keyboard/mouse but it should.)\n\nThe controls on keyboard/mouse are really easy to understand (just forward, backward, left, right, jump, for the keyboard and right hand, left hand, aim hands for mouse) but I have also heard that the controls are nice on controller and some people even recommend using controller first starting (I don't think it matters).\n\n100/100 This game is definitely worth 10 bucks (maybe the price changed but that is how much I bought it for) but even if it was 40 bucks, I would still get it because it's very worth it. (I don't commonly spend money on games)\n\nGood job No Brakes Games"

        "review": "Human: Fall Flat is an absolute gem of a game that manages to blend comedy, physics, and puzzle-solving into an incredibly enjoyable experience. Developed by No Brakes Games, this title takes players on a journey through a whimsical and surreal world, where you control a clumsy and endearing character on a quest to overcome a series of unique challenges.\n\nRight from the start, Human: Fall Flat captures your heart with its charming visuals and amusing character design. The intentionally awkward movements of your character are a constant source of laughter, making every step and jump a hilarious adventure. The game's cartoonish aesthetics perfectly complement the offbeat humor, creating an atmosphere of whimsy that keeps players engaged from start to finish.\n\nWhat sets Human: Fall Flat apart from other puzzle games is its focus on unscripted problem-solving. Rather than presenting straightforward puzzles, the game encourages players to experiment and devise their own solutions. This freedom gives rise to a sense of accomplishment when you finally figure out an unconventional way to tackle an obstacle.\n\nThe physics-based gameplay adds an extra layer of enjoyment as you wrestle with objects and the environment to reach your objectives. The controls may seem unwieldy at first, but that's part of the charm \u2013 it's not about finesse but embracing the hilarity that comes with flopping around like a ragdoll.\n\nThe level design is another highlight of the game. Each dreamlike world presents a fresh set of challenges that cleverly test your ability to think outside the box. Whether you're scaling a daunting tower, navigating treacherous platforms, or manipulating contraptions, the variety and ingenuity of the puzzles keep you entertained throughout.\n\nThe multiplayer mode enhances the fun exponentially. Cooperating with friends to overcome obstacles often leads to uncontrollable laughter and memorable moments. Watching each other's characters stumble and fumble creates a shared experience that strengthens the bond between players.\n\nOn the downside, some players might find themselves occasionally frustrated by the lack of clear instructions. This can lead to moments of confusion or getting stuck in a level. However, it's important to remember that the game's open-ended nature is intentional and encourages players to embrace experimentation.\n\nIn conclusion, Human: Fall Flat is a delightful and refreshing addition to the puzzle-platformer genre. Its clever mix of physics-based challenges, charming visuals, and abundant humor make it an unforgettable experience. Whether playing solo or with friends, the game's ability to generate countless laughter-filled moments makes it a must-play for gamers seeking a lighthearted and engaging adventure. If you're ready to embark on an offbeat journey filled with hilarity and creativity, Human: Fall Flat is the perfect choice."

Helping each other traverse the landscape and get past the puzzles.\nThere's room for a lot of co-operation and room for even more 'shenanigans', if that's your style of play.\nThe game can be tricky to get used to the controls, at least as far as newbies and casual gamers go, but if you've been gaming for years like I have, then it's pretty straight-forward.\nI would even gladly have paid full-price for this game as there's a been a lot of new content, in the form of new maps, added since release for free, as updates.\nWhen it's on sale, I'd say this is a Must-Buy."

Those faceless humanoids seemed so bland & clunky, but when you get the hang of it on joypad, dress them to your liking (you can draw/write stuff on the costumes in editor), give them names - kid's imagination transforms it all into a vast disneyland of activities. We even replay same levels many times & still find new ways to break stuff, having good laughs! It's not glitch free, but in a physics game like that even bugs are hilarious."

Is it just my innate sense to get all the achievements and consider it 'finished' in mine eyes? Or do I enjoy my way of cruising through levels by infini-climbing walls? Perhaps it is the possibilities of the character creator, or the anger caused by the very same character when their hand gets stuck behind their head, or internally losing my mind when I fail again and again to pick up and keep upright the small objects? I'm not sure what keeps me playing; and with a sequel coming out I will definitely see myself buying it; and I'm aware most people, once getting mad at the game, would quit and go on with their lives. But this game has its grip on me in some shape or form. Human: Fall Flat sure got me."

The game's charmingly awkward protagonist stumbles and flops through surreal environments, turning every mundane task into a slapstick adventure.\n\nThe open-world design allows for endless possibilities, encouraging players to experiment with solving puzzles and completing challenges in their own zany ways. The multiplayer aspect amplifies the chaos, turning cooperative tasks into a symphony of laughter and collaboration.\n\nThe physics engine, while intentionally clumsy, adds an unpredictable and comical element to every action. Maneuvering your character may seem challenging at first, but it quickly becomes part of the charm, leading to unexpected and hilarious outcomes.\n\nThe game's minimalist aesthetic complements its whimsical nature, and the soothing background music enhances the overall laid-back atmosphere. The level design is ingenious, presenting players with puzzles that require both thought and experimentation.\n\nHuman: Fall Flat is a testament to the idea that gaming should be about joy and laughter. Its unique blend of physics-based antics and cooperative gameplay makes it a standout experience for friends looking to share a good laugh. Whether you're solving puzzles or tumbling through the world with friends, Human: Fall Flat is a delightful adventure in awkwardness that guarantees smiles and laughter throughout."

I found the learning curve to be steep but once you get the controls dialed in it\u2019s tons of fun.\n\nI like how levels can be solved in a variety of ways. Some levels you can skip entire parts by climbing walls or cheesing the puzzle.\n\nFor example the end of Aztec I couldn\u2019t get the door to stay open but managed to squeeze my Gumby guy under the door using the rag doll physics, it was too funny"
