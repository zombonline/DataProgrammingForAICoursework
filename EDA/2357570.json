        "review": "Product received for free\n\nOk so where do i start...\n\nFirst off this game is a joke and was made by what i would call \"insane people\" and clearly people who have 0 experience in making money or in video game business industry.\n\nHave you ever played a game with someone who has a gun next to your face ? Because that's what playing a Blizzard activision game is.\n\n- If you afk or leave a game because your team is trolling, braindead or bad you will get penalty like not be able to play the game for an amount of time. (from 2 mins to a week or more even)\n\n- If you speak on the voice chat, if you type stuff even if you have fun or trying to make people laugh you will get a ban because Blizzard had the great idea to ban the community thanks to a random ban bot that will ban everyone for no reasons.\n\n- I reported people randomly just to see if the ban system was actually this insane and turns out i ban over 10 peoples a day because everytime i report people 1/3 i get a message from Blizzard bot saying thanks for the report thanks to you we blablabla ban that person.\n\n- The game is free to play sure but you will never ever get a skin in game since they removed Lootbox and everything needs money dosh cash to get anything, but who would put money in this game since everyone gets a ban? Don't believe me? check out the OW2 forums or steam hub to see how much people get a perma ban for no reasons.\n\n-Blizzard is by far in my opinion the worst \"company\" the video game industry has ever seen, they let every game die because they only care for money there is no passion since 90% of blizzard devs got fired or left the company (even the creator of overwatch left blizzard). Once they don't bring enough money such as starcraft, heroes of the storm and soon overwatch 2, instead of making small updates or balancing the games they just ignore the community and punish them like i said before.\n\n- This game is fun if you got time to waste, if you don't care about anything in it because let's be honest this game is unbalance/chaotic and impossible to win by yourself even if you're a genius with 300IQ you will never be able to go all by yourself more than diamond rank in competition and if you love pure toxic. I mean if i did drugs and alcohol i couldn't make this game more unbalance and chaotic as it is right now it's actually impressive how much they destroyed it.\n\n-Like i said this game is fun if you really got nothing else to play, if you don't care about anything in the game and if you're waiting for another game like marvel rivals to come out for example. But if you care about the game, want to play competition and rank up good luck to you because unless you got asians with 180 IQ as a full team you will never ever win no mather how hard you try or play.\n\n-the gameplay is 10% skill 90% luck based on random people you play with, either you are good and everyone is bad or the other way around. 9/10 games you will lose randomly and ask yourself what is the problem? me or the others no idea since everyone blames the fault on each others.\n\nSo long story short instead of supporting people who play the game and make money, blizzard was like:\n\n-remove lootbox.\n- ban 90% of people who play the game so basically 90% of people on overwatch are alt accounts or cheaters now.\n-nobody talks or use voice chat because of the ban bot.\n-the devs of this game all left long time ago even the creator because of blizzard.\n\nThis company changed ceo 5x in less than 3 years, i wonder why....(sarcasm) and now they sold it to microsoft for 66 billions or some sh*t who has no idea what to do with this \"company\" just because bill gates was like i got too much money i wanna buy some dead company.\n\nBut yeah Blizzard only has WoW now (that i never liked or played because who plays that sh*t maybe insane people and maso people who haven't seen the sun in 30 years but even then that's not sure) few more years till the company completely dies and will change to microsoft.\n\nA big fall for what used to be a big company 20 years ago.\n\nMoral of story, don't be greedy money isn't everything.\n\nThanks for reading my review !"

        "review": "TLDR: It works, it's not terrible anymore\n\n- They removed the \"unlock hero to be able to play\" monetization idea. All heroes are avaivable as soon as t hey release\n- Battle pass is annoying, but keeps the game free\n- 1 Tank reduced Role queque so much that in less than 2 minutes you can find a game.\n- All abilities that had a stun or something to keep you in place (Cassidy's grenade, Mei's freeze weapon, Briggitte shield bash) have been removed. The only ability that can still stop ultimates is Ana's sleep dart (and it's still very difficult to hit)\n- 2CP maps were removed. And while I was kinda sad to let Hanamura go... I remembered the excruciating hours of being stuck on Volskaya, Temple of Anubis or other maps for 10 minutes at the time withouth being able to make any progress.\n- Counterpicking is not as easy or direct? some heroes can still win vs their counters, with some strategy or being careful. You didn't automatically lose a game if you play Pharah and the enemy changes to a Cassidy for example.\n- The new game modes are short and fun. Nothing like 2CP.\n\nOverall, the game works. It's fun. It's not as unfair. It's not as cheap. Reapers and Sombras are annoying but they're more or less counterable. The battle pass is annoying? absolutely, but hey, it's just skins. I'm a gameplay person and gameplay works well enough.\n\nIf you liked OW1 when it wasn't plagued by GOATS, then you'll like OW2 nowadays. Call your friends, pick a role, good luck, have fun.\n\n(and if you don't like it... it's a free game, nothing to lose right?)"

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

        "review": "Alright, let's actually provide a constructive review. Why are people \"review bombing\" Overwatch 2?\n\nWe paid for Overwatch, we supported it throughout its lifespan, it was popular and liked by its community, and turning a happy profit each year.\n\nWhen Blizzard announced Overwatch 2, the big new feature they announced, the entire premise that made it \"worth the sequel treatment\" was the PvE campaign mode. Hero talent trees, customizable abilities, an expansive co-op campaign that would add to the story and lore. We were told it was going to be so much work that they wouldn't be putting out updates for Overwatch any more, they were re-allocating the staff to work on this new project.\n\nWith no updates, and no content, Overwatch started to get stale... people grew tired and bored, spending less time in the game, or moving on. Many of us stuck with the product, playing a little each week just to keep fresh... waiting for the new campaign mode. For a lot of us, playing became a chore, something we were doing out of habit, so we'd be ready for the new campaign...\n\nBut the new campaign wasn't the premise that established OW2, it was the pretext. It was a lie. Blizzard abandoned the PvE campaign a full YEAR before OW2 launched - but continued to push it in marketing as the big new feature. It's even in the announcement trailer for OW2, and on the roadmaps. They knew they'd canned it 12 months earlier, but they knew that's what people wanted, so kept putting it front and centre to get people's money, to get people to buy into the project. They took our trust and monetized it.\n\n-----\n\nWhat does OW2 ACTUALLY offer then? What did they work on for those two years that was so important that they couldn't make content for OW1, the product people paid for and were supporting?\n\n1) They overhauled the graphical engine:\n\nBefore, Overwatch would play on a relatively low spec computer, and it'd be smooth. Now, it stutters and stammers in the menus. They've added this weird shiny plastic finish to everything in the world, heroes and environment alike - so where before, heros would \"pop\" against the background and be easy to follow, now everything has the same texture to it, and it all merges together into visual noise - especially at longer ranges. They've compensated for how bad this looks by adding lots of additional flashy effects and explosions, that makes it much harder to see anything amidst the chaos. A PvP game at this pace relies heavily on quick disambiguation of what you're looking at, so you can react and compete, and the new engine makes this impossible without turning all the effects back off... meaning that the two years of development is for a feature best disabled.\n\nThe new engine also has a weird slippery \"feel\" to it. Reviewers who'd played Overwatch for 50 hours came into Overwatch 2 and reported \"look! it's the same Overwatch you love, but it's F2P now! Just ignore the monetization and you can play this great game for free!\" Established long term players with thousands of hours were on reddit complaining that their hitboxes were all over the place and shots that would previously \"feel\" like a dead certain hit were just completely whiffing, and they didn't understand why. All the timings are messed up.\n\n2) They reworked most of the heroes:\n\nTLDR: they screwed up the game balance. Previously, one of the biggest appeals of Overwatch was that you could find a hero that suited your play style, and main them, getting good at whatever suited you best. Some people like sniping, or hitscan run and gun, some people aren't good at reactionary aim and instead liked to focus on positioning, tactics and strategy. You could make a big positive different to your team by playing lucio or mercy, and paying attention to your surroundings, and positioning yourself in the right place at the right time to make the difference.\n\nWith Overwatch 2, the damage and healing behaviour has been reworked heavily. Now, the one tank on the team is insanely chunky, and it's near impossible to kill them quickly - with healer support, they can just stand in the line of fire and laugh. Everyone else dies almost immediately, regardless of who their aggressor is.\n\nTeam-fighting now is very one-note, you have one tank who's immortal if they have support, and you have four hitscan DPS characters following them - there's not a lot of difference between supports and DPS characters. The teams try to pick off the other team's DPS/Support characters, and when they pick a few off, they can finish the tank and take the objective. Repeat. There's no room for variation in play style at all, you either play a DPS and try to kill the other team DPS, or you play a tank, and try to position correctly - maybe picking off an enemy hero that gets too close to you.\n\nI understand a lot of this came from feedback at the professional levels, where support players were complaining that they wanted to have more direct impact in teamfights, they wanted the game to feel more like other FPS games - but for a large portion of Overwatch's playerbase specifically, the appeal of the game was that you could do something else and still matter.\n\n3. They got INCREDIBLY greedy with the monetization...\n\nIt's a longstanding argument that lootboxes are terrible in modern gaming... but Overwatch was one of the few examples of Lootboxes done right. Most of the long-term players of the game actually liked the system, that just rewarded you for playing the game and let you unlock whatever content you wanted relatively quickly. I started playing OW1 with the first anniversary, cleared the weekly boxes from arcade every week, and at the launch of OW2, I owned every single item in the game. Those who didn't have the time to invest in doing everything could still quickly unlock specific items they wanted (and let's be honest, when you have your favourite skin, how much do you care about unlocking other skins?) - and those who didn't want to spend hours unlocking stuff could spend a little cash to get it - if they wanted to.\n\nThe new system puts almost everything behind a paywall. The minute number of cosmetics on the \"free\" track are often insultingly lazy, simple recolours or minor alterations, while they put serious effort into skins that you can only buy for $20. The content you can unlock by grinding often feels like it only exists to drag you into interfaces that advertise the paid content for you. Even content from the first game, that was originally free, is now paid only.\n\nBattlepass systems suck. \"Pay us for the opportunity to unlock stuff if you play a lot. If you don't you have to pay us more, or lose the stuff you already paid for.\" - Limited time deals, rotating shop offers, FOMO FOMO FOMO... it reeks of manipulation and insincerity.\n\n4. Occasional DLC packs of PvE adventures.\n\nThese are Blizzard's \"new\" approach to PvE. Occasional mission packs where you can get a little bit of story and a PvE mission. You can pay (in my UK currency) \u00a313 for the DLC pack, or \u00a335 (the cost of a good indie game\" for the \"ultimate bundle\".\n\nSo here's the thing - this content is the same amount of content, and the same pace of release as the old mission scenarios - it's just now, instead of them being a free event to get people excited about playing and encourage their friends to join up - now they're paid DLC.\n\nNobody likes paying a regular subscription for a product that they previously owned completely. It doesn't make anyone like Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Office, and it doesn't make anyone like Blizzard.\n\n-----\n\nSo this is why people are \"review bombing\" your game. You took something we paid for, supported and enjoyed for years, lied to us about your plans, and turned it into trash. Now you're telling us to pay for features and content we previously enjoyed in the game we paid for. It's greedy, it's cynical, it's manipulative, and you've lost our trust.\n\nAlso you should fire Bobby Kotick."

        "review": "Product received for free\n\nOne of Overwatch's defining features is its emphasis on teamwork, yet this is also its most glaring flaw. The game is so reliant on coordinated play that a single uncooperative or underperforming teammate can sabotage an entire match. For solo queue players, the experience is often a gamble; you might land in a competent team or endure a lopsided defeat due to lack of synergy. The frustration compounds when losing feels out of your control, undermining the enjoyment of personal skill improvement.Additionally, balancing issues plague the game. Blizzard frequently reworks heroes and implements patches that either over-buff or nerf characters, creating a volatile meta. As a result, players are often forced to abandon their preferred heroes to adapt to ever-shifting trends. This cycle alienates casual gamers who simply want to enjoy their favorite characters without being penalized by the game's competitive environment.Another significant drawback is the Overwatch community. Toxicity, whether in the form of verbal abuse, trolling, or throwing matches, is a pervasive issue. While competitive games often foster heated environments, Overwatch's heavy reliance on team coordination exacerbates this problem. When a match goes poorly, blame is often hurled indiscriminately, creating a hostile atmosphere.\n\nThe problem extends to the wider community, where gatekeeping and elitism are not uncommon. New players might struggle to feel welcomed as seasoned players criticize their mistakes or dismiss them outright. Overwatch's community dynamics often make it difficult to enjoy the game as a newcomer or casual player.Blizzard Entertainment's handling of Overwatch also leaves much to be desired. Their monetization strategies, particularly with the introduction of Overwatch 2, sparked widespread criticism. The switch to a free-to-play model accompanied by aggressive microtransactions and battle passes alienated many loyal fans. Where Overwatch 1 offered all heroes and maps upfront for a one-time purchase, Overwatch 2 locked much of its content behind paywalls or grind-heavy challenges, fostering a sense of exploitation among players.Moreover, the promised PvE mode in Overwatch 2\u2014a major selling point for its sequel\u2014was significantly scaled back after years of anticipation. This move felt like a betrayal to fans who had been eagerly awaiting a more robust single-player or cooperative experience. Such decisions not only tarnish the game but also diminish trust in Blizzard as a developer.While Overwatch\u2019s gameplay was revolutionary at launch, its core mechanics have grown repetitive over the years. Despite the addition of new heroes, maps, and modes, the fundamental experience remains largely unchanged. For players who have been with the game since its early days, the lack of meaningful innovation makes the game feel stagnant.\n\nThe constant grind for competitive rank, combined with the repetitive nature of quick play and arcade modes, often leads to burnout. This monotony is further aggravated by the game's matchmaking system, which frequently pits players against significantly stronger or weaker opponents, resulting in either crushing defeats or hollow victories. Overwatch\u2019s potential as a groundbreaking team-based shooter is undeniable, but its execution leaves much to be desired. The game\u2019s reliance on teamwork, volatile balancing, and community toxicity often make it more stressful than enjoyable. Add to this Blizzard's controversial decisions and a stale gameplay loop, and it becomes clear why many players, myself included, have grown to dislike the game. While Overwatch may still hold appeal for some, its flaws overshadow its merits, making it a frustrating experience for those seeking consistent enjoyment."

        "review": "In Congress, July 4, 1776\n\nThe unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do."

Sometimes things were unfair, the enemy team was better than you, or you were teamed up with idiots, but that's how things are in most games.\n\nSometimes they would add new characters who would play major roles in the story and had their own unique play style. These new characters felt like they genuinely brought something to the table and improved the game.\n\nBut then they started listening to the crybabies who grew up with no siblings. They nerfed the fun heroes until they were no longer fun. They made the unique characters less unique. Now they all kinda feel the same and not as impactful.\n\nThey started adding more and more characters, each one feeling more crude and less creative than the last. Now they feel less like they bring something to the table and more like a desperate attempt to stop you from uninstalling.\n\nTLDR: game used to be kinda small & high quality. game is now very large & low quality. don't give them any money."

Which makes sense since the devs were so bent on sexually abusing their employees anyway, it creates the insanely realistic feel of the anguish these employees felt while creating the game. Ranked is either steamrolling or getting steam rolled because matchmaking wants you to stay so you spend money but that also means you get steamrolled by somebody else in return. Do not start playing this game, it is not worth starting as a new player.\nDo not continue playing this game, it is not worth your sanity. Do not spend money on this game, it is not worth filling the pockets of somebody who likes putting his hands where they don't belong."

With the game removing any sort of fun and moving all progression towards useless disgusting cosmetics, you can trust overwatch to deliver hundreds of pointless unending hours of grind, for little to no reward.

The original is so much better and they couldn't even accomplish what it had going for it originally with the new classic mode; too many things are changed and the originally overpowered heroes are still overpowered. In the new stuff its the same, a lot of over powered heroes or heroes that people play as exclusively because they're smurfing. I can't personally recommend it to most people but if it suits you then by all means, enjoy it as much as you can."

        "review": "So let me give my own review of this game, I like it and have been playing this game for a long time (mainly on console and since 2017/2018), but the dev's are completely incompetent at making it better. When they add a new patch it is completely and utterly wrong, just wrong, recently they buffed Doomfist when he really did not need it. Also they gave a character that just holds a button and doesn't need to aim more buffs. Like really. (Moira btw). The characters that need buffs wont receive them. There is also so much toxicity and what is called counterwatch (which is where people just switch to the character that directly counters another character.) Oh also you wanna communicate with your team and socialize watch out you say a single curse word you get suspended and that is that. No wonder there are so many smurfs and people who don't socialize because they don't wanna not be able to play for two weeks. But they don't put as much effort in banning blatant cheaters who are spin-botting in every game. Like this game is laughable it's such a joke, their attempts at improving the game just make it worse. Oh also if you look at when everyone is playing the game and having fun is when they buff Reinhardt because playing tank is just stupid anyway.\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!So note if you wanna get into this game maybe consider playing a better game to spend your time on because they are just making this game worse!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nHope this review diverts people from starting this garbage game."
